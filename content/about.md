This is a collection of newsletters distributed by the **[Home Park Community Improvement Association](https://homepark.org)** between 1986 and 1991.

**Home Park** is a charming, historic neighborhood fantastically situated between Atlantic Station, Georgia Tech, the Westside Provisions District, and Techwood Drive along the Downtown Connector in the heart of Atlanta, Ga.

#### Project overview

After being scanned, the resulting images were rotated into alignment and mostly cropped. They were then [OCR'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (the sometimes sketchy "generated text version") and the recongnized text for full newsletters run through [OpenAI's API](https://openai.com/product) (basically ChatGPT) to produce the sometimes awkward "summaries".

The site was created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [ink-free](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/ink-free/) theme.
