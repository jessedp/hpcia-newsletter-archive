TECH ABANDONS PLAN

Plans that would have put heavier traffic on
Home Park Avenue were dropped by Georgia
Tech last month thans to the work of the
Home Park Community Improvement As-
sociation.

Georgia Tech announced plans in February to
fence in their married student housing on
10th Street so that the only exit from the
property would be through Home Park Ave.
Dr Clyde Robbins, vice president for plan-
ning, says this move would make the 236-unit
apartment complex more secure, give the resi-
| dents access to the red light at 10th and State
| streets, and allow easier access to 10th Street.

HPCIA President Dr. John Heise expressed
neighborhood concerns to Georgia Tech and
stated that the Institute’s plans would be total-
ly unacceptable to area residents. Heise
pointed out that Home Park streets are al-
ready overloaded and congested and that
Tech’s action would make a bad situation
worse. Heise also noted to Robbins that plans

tion’s work to lessen traffic on neighborhood
streets.

Responding to President Heise’s letter, Dr.
Henry Bourne, acting president of Georgia
Tech, changed Tech’s position and had Dr.
Robbins develop another plan for the housing
project. Dr Robbins assured the Association
that the new plans call for all access and exits
| of the complex to remain on 10th Street but

| with the addition of gates to restrict flow into
the area.

The Association is pursuing the possibility of
a pressure-activated stoplight for the Tech
complex at their 10th Street exit. This action
would also help lessen the number of married

student housing cars using Home Park
Avenue.
