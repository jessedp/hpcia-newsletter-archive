November Meeting
Nov. 5, 7:00 P.M.

Our city council members were unable to
attend our August meeting so, we have
invited them to attend the November 5th
meeting. The meeting will be at the Learning
Center.

The Home Park Community Association's
Board of Directors will present a slate of
board Nominees for voting at the November
meeting. Please make sure you exercise your
right to decide on neighborhood policy
makers. Remember you must be a current
paid member of the association to be able to
vote.

Business Member Tea

The Business Members Tea has been
rescheduled for Nov. 14 at 4:00 P.M. All
business owners in the community are
invited to attend “Tea with Theresa” at our
local landmark, The Silver Skillet.

New Business in Home Park

Kool Korner “Divine Food” opens. Home
Park Community welcomes Tina St. Clair the
new owner. Tina has daily specials and she says

this enables her to serve the freshest food. Tina is
open from 11:00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M. and on Friday
night there is a dinner theater. The Friday night
Theater begins at 8:00 P.M. and for $10.00 you get
a 3 course meal & entertainment. Reservations are
made for Friday by calling Tina at 874-6461. Good
luck, Tina!

A New Look

Our local landmark the Silver Skillet has a
new look inside. Theresa Breckenridge, the
owner, has painted, redecorated and enlarged
the little Skillet. If you get a chance, stop in and
see what Theresa has done.

In The News

The Home Park Learning Center was chosen
by the Atlanta Fire Safety Unit and 11 Alive to
show the public how children are taught about
fire safety.

Our center was on the 6:00 news conducting a
fire drill. We are proud of our children and staff
in the manner they handled themselves.

Home Park invites you to visit our center
sometime.
