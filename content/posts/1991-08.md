Newsletter Catastrophe

This is the first newsletter that our readers are seeing
in quite a while, in fact a newsletter has not been done
since January. The Board of Directors would like to
humbly apologize for letting the newsletter drop out
of sight for so long. We do feel that outside of the
monthly community meetings, the newsletter is the
most effective way of keeping our neighbors and
other interested parties informed on the issues affect-
ing Home Park. In this newsletter, we hope to update
all the old news and present the new happenings that
you may have missed. The newsletter will be sent out
every two months.

September Community Meeting
The September meeting of the Association will be
held at the Learning Center on Monday, September
9th, at 7:00 pm.
Susan Newell, the city aborist will be speaking on,
you guessed it, trees. Home Park has many old stately
trees and we should be getting some information on
caring for the existing trees and planting for the
future. — a se my
The second speaker will be a representative from
EarthTeam '96. EarthTeam '96 is a group building a
coalition of environmental groups that plan to ensure
a "green" Olympics in 1996. Their phone number is

pee ee Thieves Caught?

We have a recent word of mouth report that there
was a rash of lawn equipment thefts around State
Street and the thieves were finally caught.

Two picnic tables were stolen from the playground at
the Learning Center. The tables are painted green
and the benches are attached. This is not a crime of
opportunity done by a transient, the tables are heavy.
Please call Brenda at the Learning Center, 872-4572,
or Craig & Cathy Taylor, 874-3405, if you have any
details.

Home Park Festival

Saturday, October 5th
Home Park will have a festival on Saturday, October
Sth. Bring the whole family down to the park in Home
Park, next to the Learning Center, on Saturday, Octo-
ber 5th for an old-fashioned good time. Home Park h
a long tradition of community celebration and fun,
dating back to the Trick-or-Treat spirit of the "Christ-
mas Serenades" early in this century. To resurrect
some of that sense of community there will be music,
art exhibits, performers, food and a carnival for the
children. Don't feel left out if you are not a resident,
we want you to be there also!
We've finally decided to let the secret out; Home Park
is the best neighborhood in Atlanta and getting better.

Association Membership
Membership in the Association continues to grow.
Currently, there are over 120 individual and business
members. Only as a member of the Association do you
have the right to vote in neighborhood issues and make

Olympic News

Members of the community association are already
involved in the planning of the Olympics taking place
in our back yard only five short years from now. Many
of the plans for development are not final, which is
clear from the many conflicting stories in the media.
One major change from the information presented in a
community meeting last year seems to be that the twin

considered. The plans for the Tech campus as the
Olympic Village are still intact. :

A major step for the neighborhood is official designa-
tion by the City as an Olympic Impact Neighborhood.
This designation should keep us in the know when it
comes to the realization of the Olympics.

RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMITS

ee Nast?

AVAILABLE
History

Home Park has been around longer than the
automobile. Our streets were not designed to provide
convenient parking for the current number of cars.
The growth of the multi-car family combined with the
dramatic increase in rental properties, with several
cars per household, and more non-residents finding
our neighborhood a convenient and ‘‘inexpensive’’
parking lot, has made parking a daily problem in parts
of the neighborhood.

Several years ago the Home Park Associa- _
tion’s board formed a committee to deal with parking
and traffic concerns in the neighborhood. Since that
ume, the committee has emphasized enforcement —
issues and addressed concerns voiced from our neigh-
bors.

The SPI Overlay

One of the first major parking solutions was as
a result of the SPI overlay. This zoning overlay
requires that new housing construction, renovations
and duplex conversions provide one off-street parking
space for each bedroom. This provides the best
protection to the problem of unchecked growth in
multiple tenant/family housing.

The Parking Ordimance

The committee then started to address the
parking congestion caused by non-residents. Without
special rules established by city government, we have
no legal right to limit parking access on ‘‘our’’
streets. While researching the precedents set by cities
like Gainesville, Florida (next to the University of
Florida) we found that Atlanta was already consider-
ing some similar legislation due to pressure from
Ansley Park and other neighborhoods. With the
sponsorship of Council member Buddy Fowlkes, the
Residential Permit Parking Area ordinance (RPPA)
was passed; the ordinance limits parking in certain
areas, unless the auto has a neighborhood parking
permit. At a June 1990 community meeting, the
Home Park membership voted to press for an amend-
ment to the ordinance to increase the number of
permits to at least two for each household.

Recently, the amendment passed the City
Council. The specifics of the RPPA are as follows:

-Residents must petition to the city to have their
street or block designated for restricted parking. At
least 70% of the effected residents/property owners
must agree to the designation.

-Signs limiting parking to two hours will be
placed in the areas requested.

-Residents will be issued up to two permits per
exceed the two-hour limit. Visitor permits will also be
available.

-There will be an annual charge of $12.00 for the
permits.

How to start the permit process

The community association will not force any
area to be effected by the RPPA, but we will definitely
assist in the process. We know many of you are
frustrated by the parking problems on your street and
will provide the support so you can ‘‘do it your-
selves’*. Ss

parking on your street, talk to your neighbors and see if
they agree. The association can provide information
on property owners if houses are not owner occupied.
Select someone as the main contact for your block or
street. Contact Bill Patterson at 897-1195 or come toa
community meeting and discuss how to coordinate the
process. The “‘block coordinator’ will be given
instructions and petitions.

Parking Violations

As a general note, since we are asking the
police to enforce parking regulations, the neighbor-
hood needs to adhere to all existing laws. Enforcement
of these rules does not require yellow curbs or specific
signs. Following is a reminder of some of the basic
rules that are commonly violated:
-Parking within 10 ft. of a corner.
-Parking within 3 ft. of driveway. You can’t block a_
driveway, not even your own!
-Parking within 6 ft. of a fire hydrant.
-Parking against the flow of traffic.
-Parking on sidewalks. Remember that blocking the
sidewalk forces pedestrians to walk in the street!

if you feel that you want some way to control _|~

Community Meeting Roundup
Everybody is welcome and attendance is up! Follow-
ing is a recap of past community meetings and new
developments:

February Crime Prevention Tips. Some handy
tips on crime prevention for yourself and your home.
They provided order forms for purchase of defense
products.

March Clean City Commission. The neigh-
borhood definitely showed it's colors, and they were
green. The speaker generated much interest and many
questions about recycling and the City's current pilot
curbside pickup program.

April Ga Tech Planning meeting with Sasaki
Associates was held on March 25th at the Methodist.
Church. Thanks to Jug Harris for providing the space
for one of the most crowded meetings in recent
memory. The planning group certainly heard our
opinions on the current relationship with Ga. Tech and
how we would like to be a part of the growth and not a
victim of expansion. Sasaki said they would be back
after their plans were formalized, but we have not
heard when they may return.

After Sasaki left ,the discussion turned to the
Fulton County assessments. Some information was
distributed on the formal and informal appeals process.
The association had planned to have a form letter
available for requesting an informal review, but we
found that the assessors recommended a phone call.
May Atlantic Steel/Bike Paths. Two people
involved with the sale of the plant and one from the
City spoke on the plans for Atlantic Steel. There are
still no concrete details on the future of the site.

June Committee Resource Network. Three
members of this organization distributed information
and answered questions on getting action when deal-
ing with City and County departments. They comple-
mented Home Park on it's strong involvement with
local government.

July Ga. Dept. of Agriculture. Latrisha
Hughes spoke on food inspection, food safety and
other consumer information. A timely offering con-
sidering the current media attention to the subject.
August City Department of Housing. Muriel
Mitchell spoke on housing code enforcement, housing
preservation and the available housing rehabilitation

programs.

The second speaker presented ideas for bike lanes and —

Learning Center Equipment
Thanks to Guy Gunter, of Guy Gunter Jr. and Associates on 14th
St., for providing the Center with a much needed replacement for
the old stove and dishwasher in the kitchen, at a much needed
good price. We really appreciate the assistance from a neighbor-
hood business.
Home Park Shopper
Everybody in the neighborhood should have received a book of
coupons from local merchants. Over one thousand of the coupon
books where distributed. The businesses that participated where
Burger King, The Framers, Ga. Lighting and 10th Street Cleaners.
Let's use those coupons and continue to support local business.
New Park Benches
The park in Home Park has some lovely new benches, thanks in
part to a grant from Amoco Corporation and as always some
good work on the part of our neighbors. Amoco provided the
funds for the purchase of the teak benches, Park Pride provided
the labor and materials for installation at-no cost-and Elaine-
Galloday helped coordinate the whole operation. Come on down
to the park and try the benches on for size!
We also had a sign erected in the park, clearing indicating that it
is a city park. The obvious, but sometimes confusing, name that
the neighborhood decided on when the park was dedicated is
Home Park.

Committee Happenings
Land Use

Tom Mowe of Home Park Awe. recently replaced Beth
Morford of State St. as the head of the committee.

Community Association in May, 1990, the mission of
the Land Use Committee includes preserving the
residential areas of the and preventing
encroachment by commercial or institutional uses that
would affect the residential character of the neighbor-
hood. The committee also reviews rezoning requests
and presents recommendations to the Board of Direc-
tors.

_ Environment
We are looking for a new home for the newspaper
recycling bin. The company that owned the bin had
problems getting access in the parking lot of the
Learning Center. If amyone can provide a new loca-
tion, please contact the Association.

Public Safety

| While property crime still seems to be the most com-
mon, there have been a few more serious crimes
against people in this year. Most crimes are taking
place during the day.

While the neighborhood has been asking for increased
police presence to discourage people from "Herbie
Harvesting" on Tuesday, many neighbors seem to
invite-this activity by leaving cans on the sidewalk and
at curbside. Everybody wants to help those less fortu-
nate, but we know that many criminals are blending in
with the homeless. Help us cut down crime!

Report all crimes to the Atlanta Police Bureau and also
inform Craig and Cathy Taylor of the Public Safety
committee. The Taylors are trying to keep crime
Statistics for the neighborhood, but do not seem to be
getting much information. It is very important for the
neighborhood to have these independent records, so we

can get the support from the City that we need.
