NOVEMBER 1989

MOSQUE BUILDING PLANS TOPIC GF:
NOVEMBER 6 MEETING

~, Representatives fonr the Atlanta Mosque, also knowri
as the Al Farooq Masjid, will be at the Monday, Novem-
ber 6, meeting of the Home Park Community to talk
about building plans on Tumlin and 14th Streets..The
meeting time is 7:30 p.m. at the Learning Center.

The Masjid is currently constructing a two-story
educational facility to replace a trailer on the site.
Scheduled to be completed at the first of the year, the
building will initially be used for Sunday school while
the paperwork is completed for the educational pro-
gram.

According to Mohannad Malas, spokesperson for
the Masjid, the school will follow a regular public school
curriculum for 4 to 10 year olds with additional classes
in Arabic and Islam. The school’s name is Dar-un-
Noor, which translated, means House of Light.

Malas stresses the Masjid’s wishes to have better
communication with the area and immediate neigh-
bors. “We think that Home Park is a fantastic location
for us,” says Malas. “And we hope that we can play a
role in the stabilization of the area.”

There are hopes that the 14th Street location will
become a Cultural Center for Islam in Atlanta.

RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT UPDATE

The Association is asking for volunteers to serve on the
Traffic and Transportation Committee so that we can
begin the process for implementing the new Residen-
tial Parking Permit ordinance.

Several phone calls from local residents have raised
questions about some aspects ofthe ordinance, mainly,
the one per residence requirement. We have talked
with Councilmember “Buddy” Fowlkes about having
the ordinance amended to read “one per resident.”

Another question concerns proving residency. This
is a particular problem for dwellings with several unre-
lated person living in them. One method that has been
suggested is using lease agreements with the legal

‘| cause problems for

renters’ names on them.
This, of course, would ;

illegal room-mate_
situations, but this
is the property
owner's problem,
not Home Park's.

If you are interested in helping with the Parking
Permit, please contact the Association's office at 872-
4572. Board member Bill Patterson, who lives on
Snyder Street, is chairing this committee. Volunteers
will be needed to circulate petitions on affected streets
and to call property owners of multi-family dwellings.
We hope to have a meeting ofall volunteers by the end
of the year.

BOARD ELECTIONS

The Home Park Community Association's Board of
Directors will present a slate of board nominees for
voting on by community members at the November 6
meeting.

The Association has had a good response for
nominations from both residential and business com-
munity members. Please make sure you exercise vour |
right to decide on neighborhood policy makers.
Remember, you must be a current paid member of the
Association to be able to vote.

SO LONG VIC MASLIA
HELLO CLAIR MULLER

Even though he served only one year in the Atlanta City
Council representing Home Park, Vic Maslia becamea
great friend to our neighborhood. He responded
immediately to our invitation to meet him, and unhesi-
tatingly picked up from Richard Guthman in playing
Santa Claus for area children.

Vic was always available and when you asked
something from him, he worked until he got it done.

The neighborhood hopes that new councilmem-

November 6 community meeting. And congratula-

NEIGHBOR RECOMMENDS
