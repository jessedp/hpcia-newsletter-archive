“STATE STREET ACADEMY"
NOW OPEN FOR OCCUPANCY

The old Home Park Elementary School,
now known as the State Street Academy,
is now partially open for occupancy. And,
according to Board Member Walt
Knoechel, six apartments in the main
school are now occupied.

Knoechel, who is a vice president for the
developer, Great Oaks Properties, says that
the firm is very pleased with the interest in
the apartments and is looking at the end of
summer for 100 percent occupancy.

The new construction is scheduled to be
completed in mid-April along with the
remainder of the townhouses in the main
building. Rent for the apartments average
around $275 per month, and the town
houses are going for $725 to $1,000 per
month.

Knoechel says that the typical renter is an
in-town person who has already lived in-
town and works there also. They are
typically young professionals and work at
such places as IBM and Coca-Cola.

Home Park Residents are invited to visit
the model apartment in the main building
from 11 a.m. — 6 p.m. Saturdays and
Sundays.

HOME PARK LEARNING CENTER
RECEIVES AWARD FOR WORK
WITH MENTALLY RETARDED

The Home Park Learning Center was
presented an award for outstanding service
to mentally retarded citizens at Retarded
Citizens/Atlanta's annual awards banquet
in February.

The Learning Center was cited primarily

_for its work-with Project Resuce, anon-—
profit organization that works with
families where the parents are mentally
retarded or who have mentally retarded
children. Under the program, parents learir
good parenting skills at the Center while
their children can participate in a pre-
school program.

The Center has a policy of accepting
children with physical and mental
handicaps who would benefit from being
in a learning environment with non-
disabled children.
