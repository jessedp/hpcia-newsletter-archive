Back to the Drawing Board
NEIGHBORHOOD
EXPLORING TAILOR-MADE
ZONING REGULATIONS

It’s back to the drawing board for the Home
Park Communty Improvemnt Association and
its work to stop the deterioration of the Home
Park neighborhood. Meeting with Bill
Kennedy from the City of Atlanta’s zoning
department, Association representatives were
told that down-zoning to R-4 was not the
solution to stop the erosion of housing quality
in this neighborhood.

Mr. Kennedy stated that he could not support
the down-zoning because of the many diverse
elements in the area that would be affected by
it. Kennedy’s suggestion is to look at the
Inman Park Special Public Interest District and
possibly model a new land use and rezoning
effort after Inman Park’s example.

— .

Inman Park developed a land use plan whereby
two sets of regulations applied to I) the entire
neighborhood and 2) to three subareas within.
the neighborhood. The resulting zoning
regulations require building designs to be
compatible with existing structures, require
high-quality housing, encourage a variety of
housing types and densities, and encourage
owner occupancy and the construction of
affordable housing. These are the types of
goals that the Home Park area would like to
see achieved.

Working with a comprehensive land use plan,
zoning requirements can be tailored to suit the
needs of the Home Park area. For instance,
like Inman Park, the area can be subdivided
into several areas which have their own zoning

regulations. Four meetings scheduled for the
month of May will address four subareas
identified in the Home Park area: the area
west of Hemphill, the area north of 14th Street,
the main part of the neighborhood between 10th
and 14th Streets and the commercial element.
(See meeting schedule for dates, times, and

locations.)

Every interest group in the neighborhood must
have input into this procedure. These groups
include: investors, business owners, renters,
institutions such as Georgia Tech, home
owners, developers, students and land
speculators. Every group will have a say in
designing a land use plan for the neighborhood
and in recommending zoning regulations for
enforcing the plan.

Meetings to start the process will be scheduled
during the summer. To assure your input
please attend meetings that you are invited to.
There will be public hearings at a certain point
in the process, but you need to get involved
now.

For further information contact Peggy S. |
Bronn, executive director of the Community
Association, at 872-4572. She can answer any
questions that you may have.

SUBSTANDARD

HOUSING IDENTIFIED

Buildings were in the neighborhood recently

violations were on Curran and Hampton
Streets with some on 10th Street.

The Atlanta city government recently upgraded
their housing code regulations to make it easier
to prosecute people who let their propety

applauds this action on the part of the city.

problems in this area. If you have reason to
