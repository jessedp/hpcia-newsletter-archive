County-Wide Property Reappraisal

Fulton County is currently conducting a county-wide
reappraisal program for the purpose of equalizing
property assessments based on current market value.
According to officials from the Atlanta/Fulton Coun-
ty Board of Tax Assessors, the goal is to have all

properties within Fulton County, including the City of
Atlanta, to 40 percent of assessed market value.

The Board is collecting information by taking color
photos of every property within the county and by
data collectors visiting homes and businesses. The
process is currently underway and data collectors
have been reported in the Home Park neighborhood.

It has been a number of years since a complete proper-
ty reappraisal has been done in Atlanta/Fulton Coun-
ty, and it is hoped that the new program will equalize
and modernize the process. Home Park will try to
schedule this issue as the topic of discussion for the
February meeting.

Executive Director and Pastor Owen
Speak on Tech to Atlanta/Fulton
Senate Delegation

Home Park Executive Director Peggy Simcic Brénn

and 10th Street United Methodist Church Pastor
George Owen addressed the Atlanta /Fulien Senate
Delegation on December 6 regarding concerns that
the neighborhood has about Georgia Tech.

Ms. Brénn and Pastor Owen outlined Home Park’s
position on its future growth and what the neighbor-
hood would like to see happen in the area. Specific
suggestions to the delegation were 1) that Home Park
be represented on the Georgia Tech strategic planning
committee, 2) that the State legislature insist that Geor-
gia Tech look at future planning with an emphasis on
quality urban development, 3) that any new plans be
coordinated with City of Atlanta planners and 4) that
all of Home Park’s concerns be addressed to the
proper legislative committee for action.

Arecent letter to the community from Tech President
Dr.John Crecine notes that 1989 is the end of the 25-
year campus plan adopted by the institution in 1964.
Crecine states that a new plan will focus on Tech’s ex-
ternal environment, including Home Park. T. 4s-
sociation believes that any plans affecting Home Park
should include participation by neighborhood repre-
sentatives. We are asking the Georgia Senate Delega-

Executive Director Elected to
Represent Atlanta Neighborhoods to
Atlanta Olympic Committee

The Atlanta Planning and Advisory Board elected
Home Park Executive Director Peggy Simcic Brénn to
represent Atlanta’s neighborhoods to the Atlanta Or-
ganizing Committee for the 1996 Olympics.

Ms. Br6nn’s election was in response to her successful
efforts over the past six months in getting the AOC to
recognize the necessity of neighborhood input into
the Olympic planning process. The APAB committee
will begin its representation to the AOC with neigh-
borhdods stich as Home Park who will be impacted
by some aspect of the Olympic agenda. In Home
Park’s case it will be the Olympic Village planned for
the Tech campus.

The International Olympic Committee will make its
site selection in September 1990.

munity Improvement Association for 1990 are: Lee
