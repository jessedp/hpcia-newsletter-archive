Residents are asked to meet at 10:00 a.m. at the Learning

instruments. We will be cleaning sidewalks and streets,
picking up garbage and asking neighbors to move their
Herbie Curbies off the sidewalks.

Our City Council members will receive a “Golden
Broom” with a notch on it for Home Park’s efforts. This
is a great way to meet your neighbors and put your
energy into working instead of complaining.

LETTER FROM
JOHN LUPTON

The 1988 Session of the Georgia General
Assembly ended March 7th, with mixed reviews
from both politicians and pundits. As 1988 is an
election year, the conventional wisdom is only
partially correct.

The biggest event of all was the approval of a $6
billion budget for the state, the largest ever. As has
been the habit over the last few years, education
was a big winner in the budget, with increased
funding given to capital improvements, teacher
pay, and employee reviews and benefits. The
capital improvements section impacts Georgia

| ech in that it will receive new dollars to continue
_its growth, Ihave been assured by the

~fhancellor’s office that Tech will not be expanding
north of 10th Street, as has been rumored.

This session passed a seat—belt law, but one that
was so weak as to almost be worthless. In a similar
vein, we increased the speed limit on rural
highways to 65 mph. A bill of more local interest,
set up the mechanism and initial funding for a
domed stadium, to be part of the World Congress
Center. We are continuously assurred that your
taxes won’t be raised to pay for any part of the
stadium. I am personally a bit skeptical on that
point.

| Allin all the ‘88 session was generally positive.
T’'ll be sending out a detailed newsletter soon to

more fully explain what did and did not come to
pass in the Georgia General Assembly.
