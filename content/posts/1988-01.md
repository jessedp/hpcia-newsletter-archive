HPCIA MEETS

NEW TECH PRESIDENT satin
HPCIA president, John Heise and Executive 3
Director Peggy Bronn, met with Dr. John P.
Crecine, new president of Georgia Tech, in
December. The HPCIA representatives met with
Crecine in an attempt to start a new era of-reiations
with Tech, one that will mean more openness on
both sides.

Some topics that were discussed included the
housing stock in the neighborhood that Tech
students typically live in, parking problems, and
Tech’s getting into day care. Crecine assured all
parties that he was interested in the welfare of Tech
students and their living conditions and supported
HPCIA’s suggestion that Tech housing not list
substandard housing for rental. As regards Tech
day care, he said that if it became an eventuality it
would not be open to the public, a position that the
neighborhood association supports. If Tech day
care was open to the public it would come into
direct competition with Home Park’s own Center.

Crecine had fewer suggestions about handling
parking problems, although he did acknowledge its
seriousness. He supports the idea of satellite

~ parking and more on-campus housing. Satellite
parking would provide storage for cars when
Students are not using them, and more on-campus
dorms would help lessen the number of students
looking for off-campus housing. The new
president also reiterated Tech’s stand that the
campus would not expand north of their current
10th Street boundary.

This was one of the first times that neighborhood
leaders have been able to meet with a Tech
president. Dr. Heise is encouraged by the meeting
and looks forward to more normalized relations in
the future. Dr. Crecine was presented a copy of the
recently completed Home Park Study that outlines
in detail the impact Georgia Tech has on this
community. He was also given two recent articles

-on Home Park that appreared in Southline, a
weekly newspaper.

FIRST ANNUAL
HOME PARK GALA TO BE HELD AT

BOBBY & JUNE’S
The first annual Home Park “gala” will be held on

Monday, January 18, 8:00 p.m. at Bobby and
June’s Kountry Kitchen on 14th Street. Bobby
Crowe, co-owner of the restaurant is donating his
famous country cooking for the event, which we
hope to be the first of many annual meetings for the
Home Park neighborhood.

The neighborhood association hopes that through
events such as these, people in Home Park will get -
out, meet one another and get involved in this
unique area. Anyone who lives or who is

interested in Home Park is invited to attend. This

is also chance to recognize those who have helped
us in the past year and to honor in-coming and
out-going board members.

It is with deep appreciation that we thank Bobby
Crowe for donating his restaurant and his time for
this occasion. Although this is not the first ime
Bobby has served his community. He closes his
restaurant and forgoes vacation in order to serve up
food for the Henry Grady Lions Club on Labor
Day, and he feels he’s just giving a little back to
the neighborhood that nurtured him.

We do ask that you call the Learning Center at
872-4572 to let us know if you’re coming. Seating
is limited and we'd hate to turn you away at the
door. Also, there will be no meeting on January Il,
the regularly scheduled community meeting date.

There will also be a representative of the Trust
Company Bank at Bobby and June’s to tell
residents about low-interest money the bank has
available for purchasing or renovating homes in
Home Park.
