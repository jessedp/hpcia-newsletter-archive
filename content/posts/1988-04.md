AT LAST, A REAL PARK FOR
HOME PARK

Currently underway is a project that will
create a park out of the ballfield next to the
Home Park Learning Center. Virtually
neglected as a play area, this field is being
turned into a genuine park for the neighbor-
hood.

According to Cindy McCall, District 4 Parks
Maintenance Manager, the grounds are being
converted under the Beautification Incentive
Program. Begun by Deen Day Smith, the
program is a city-wide competition by the
Atlanta Parks Department for beautifying the
city’s parks. Deen Day Smith is the widow of
the founder of Days Inn and is a well-known
benefactoress to many charities in Atlanta.

McCall, who will oversee the Home Park
project, says that the field will be-recontoured

with addedtrees and-even-reck gardens. The -

plans call for picnic tables, stationary garbage
cans, and many flowering plants. McCall
expects the project to be completed in mid-
May, at which time there will be a dedication
ceremony and a new name for the area
selected by community residents.

McCall will speak on the project and show
plans for its development at the next meeting
of the Community — Monday, April 4, 7:30
p.m. at the Learning Center. It must be noted
that the team working on the Home Park
project won last year’s competition with its
renovation of the J.D. Sims Recreation Center
grounds near Georgia Baptist Hospital.

AREA COUNCILMEMBER RESIGNS

Richard Guthman, long-time council member
for Home Park, resigned his position last
month citing a need to attend more to his gov-
ernmental banking position at First American
Bank.

While representing only a portion of Home
Park, Guthman has done much to benefit the
whole area. Guthman and Buddy Fowlkes
share Home Park with each having a section
on the west and east sides of State Street, re-
spectively.

Some of Guthman’s assistance to this neigh-
borhood include: obtaining a $254,000
Community Development Block Grant to
renovate the abandoned recreation center into

a community-run child care center; along with

| Fowlkes, sponsoring legislation to make

| Home Park a Special Public faterest District; —

being within telephone distance for getting”
faster response from City bureaus including
Traffic, Parks and Recreation and Community
Development; and taking a personal interest in
the child care center by hosting a Christmas
party for the last two years for the center’s
children.

The neighborhood thanks Richard for his
support and wishes him well.

The Atlanta City Council should be appoint-

ing a new council member to serve out
Guthman’s term at its April 4 meeting.
Persons interestd in being named for this
position will be registering the week of March
21-24, after this newsletter comes out. The
public can write letters or call councilmem-
bers regarding candidates’ qualifications. The
HPCIA will get a list of the candidates. You
may call 872-4572 the week of March 28 to

HOME PARK PUT IN
NEW POLICE ZONE

Thanks to a realignment of police zones in the
City Of Atlanta, Home Park is losing its now
familiar beat officers and is being placed in a
new zone. Home Park is currently in Zone 2
headquartered on Piedmont Avenue. The new
zone is Zone 5 which is headquartered in the
Omni.

The process must begin again of signing a
new Partnership Against Crime agreement, in-
troducing these officers to the needs of this
community and convincing them that we are
important enough to warrant that extra touch
that Zone 2 has supplied so willingly. We
will be competing with down-town now, but

“| Lt. Hagin of Zone 5 assures us our new

| officers will give us the same attention we ve

*~ come to expect from the Atlanta Police

Department.

CORRECTION

The Home Park newsletter inaccurately
listed one-room apartments at the State

Street Academy-as renting for $275 per
month. This should have been $725 per

month. Sorry.
