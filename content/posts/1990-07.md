JULY/AUGUST 1990

New Executive Director

“Home” Girl
New Executive Director Brenda Lance is a
“home” girl. Born and raised on State and
Francis Streets, Brenda Heard Lance is

returning to Home Park as the neighbor-
hood's Executive Director.

Brenda’s association with Home Park dates
back three generations; not only did Brenda
and her three sisters attend Home Park
Elementary School so did her mother. And.
her grandfather was a property owner on
State Street.

The new executive director says that
returning to Home Park is like coming home.
“T can’t say that the neighborhood has
changed a lot,” says Brenda. “The houses are
still the same and the loyalty to the neighbor-
hood is still here.”

According to Brenda, who has an extensive
background in child care management, her
toughest job is going to be filling the shoes
left by Peggy Brénn. “Peggy just knew so
much about City politics, zoning matters,
and issues in the neighborhood. Iam going
to need everybody's help to catch up.”

Brenda has 17 years experience in child care.

The last five years were as a district manager
for a large child care chain. She is bringing
excellent personnel and financial manage-
ment skills to the Home Park Learning
Center,

“T really didn't know that all these things
were happening down here in Home Park,”
says Brenda. “I really want to continue to
make progress in keeping this area alive.”

Brenda currently makes her home in Cobb
County with her husband and three children.

August Meeting

Home Park’s City Council members are
invited to speak at the August 6th meeting to
address general issues before the city council.
Notices will be sent out prior to the August
date as a reminder.

Business Members to Begin
Tea Meetings

Beginning in September Home Park
Community Association business members are
invited to have “Tea with Theresa” owner of
the local landmark, the Silver Skillet

The object of what will become quarterly
meetings is to give business members an
opportunity to get together with neighborhood
leaders to discuss issues of importance to the
commercial areas as well as the residential
sector.

The Community Association recognizes that it
is difficult for business members who don’t live
in the neighborhood to attend community
meetings in the evening.

All area businesses are invited to attend the
first meeting. Subsequent meetings will be free
for Association members; non-members must
pay a fee for refreshments. Invitations will be
sent in August.

Welcome
Grenada

Land Use Resolution Passes

Members of the Community Association
unanimously passed the most recent land use
resolution at the May neighborhood meeting.

The resolution, which will be included in
the corporation's by-laws, charges the land
use committee with protecting the residential
areas from encroachment by commercial or
institutional uses that would affect the
character of the neighborhood.

The resolution puts into action a philosophy
which has always been understood by the
land-use committee, but was never
formalized for long term-purposes.

SS Nee

Continue to report all crimes to Craig and
Cathy Taylor, Public Safety chairs. And file a
police report no matter how trivial the crime.

Call Association offices at 872-4572 with
information on abandoned cars. The beat
beat officer picks up this information weekly.

Land Use — There is an opening on the
Land Use Committee. Anyone wanting to
serve on this very important committee
should call Beth Morford at the listed
number.

Deepest Sympathy

Itis with deepest sadness that we say
farewell to one of Home Park's staunchest
supporters. Mr. Bill Ward passed away while

working in his garden in May of this year. Bill
and his wife Evelyn attended every community
meeting, committee meeting and special events
that the neighborhood sponsored. We will miss
him stirring things up.

Also, we offer condolences to Leona Reynolds,
who lost her husband William this year. It is
very sad to lose such long-standing members of
this community.
