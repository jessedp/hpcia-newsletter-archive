According to Wayne, the building is thought to
have started out as a stable in the 1860’s and then
was converted to a store around the turn of the

Georgia and one of only two im the Southeast.

limestones quarried in Bavaria. And Wayne is
currently expanding his print shop to include a
gallery that features Georgia artists as well as
