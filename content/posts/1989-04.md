APRIL 1989

BOARD VOTES TO EXPAND
The Board of Directors of the Home Park Community
Improvement Association, Inc. voted at its March 6

| meeting to amend its by-laws to provide for a larger

board of directors.

According to Presidentlee Richardson, the ex-
panded board will maintain the current core of 10
members who will have the responsibility for all the
decision making. Additional spaces will be honorary
positions in recognition of persons who have an inter-
est in the community or learning center but who do not
want to be involved in their day-to-day operation.

The executive director of the association is cur-
rently researching the proper language for amending
the by-laws.

POLICE LIAISON OFFICER TO
SPEAK AT APRIL 3 MEETING

The Midtown Liaison Officer for Police Zone 5 will be
the guest speaker at the Monday, April 3, 7:30 p.m.,
meeting of the Home Park community at the Learning
Center. :

subjects including: how to get quicker police response,
the neishborhood s parking probiems, an introduction
of our new zone major, Mullins, and an update on
crime in the area.

Officer Alexander and new Beat Officer Rocky
Merritt have already acquainted themselves with the
neighborhood and have been brought up-to-date on
the area. Officer Merritt has been busy the last month
impounding cars, and Officer Alexander has promised
to step up patrols in areas that have recently been hit by
break-ins.

NOTE: There have been several break-ins north of
14th Street. Teenagers are suspected in several of the
incidents. If you see anyone of your street that you do
not know or who looks out on place (including tran-
sients), do not hesitate to call 911.

MICHAEL LOMAX TO SPEAK
AT MAY 1 MEETING

Current Fulton County Commissioner and Mayoral
candidate Michael Lomax will speak at the May 1
meeting of the Home Park community.

The association tried to get both candidates on the
same agenda, but Maynard Jackson had a conflict. He
assures us he will speak sometime this summer.

More information on the May 1 meeting will be in
the May newsletter.

FIRE MARSHALL REPORT
RENTERS TAKE NOTE

Lt. Anthony Jackson, speaking at the February meeting
of the neighborhood, promised Home Park that the
Fire Department would help make streets passable and
would also help police landlords who do not furnish
smoke detectors.

According to Lt. Jackson, Fire Department Field
Operations can request that a ladder truck be sent into
the area to test the neighborhood streets to ensure that
the truck can get down them in case of fire. Ifa truck
cannot drive down a street, the fire department will see
to it that the street is made accessible. Some streets to
be tested first are Curran, McMillan, Ethei and Center.

Since 1981, the City Charter has stated that all
rental property must have smoke detectors. In new
and some rehab construction, the smoke detectors
must be “hardwire” or electrically activitated. The
number of detectors depends on the size of the unit.
There must be a detector on every floor and in every
unit in the case of duplexes or multi-unit properties.
The Charter further states that landlords must submit
compliance forms to the Fire Marshall's office as proof
that the smoke detectors are maintained and operable.
Anyone who rents property is guaranteed of this right.

The fire department will perform further service by
inspecting homes to see how fire safe they are. By
dialing 658-6905, a resident can request an inspection
and get advice on improving the safety of their home.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Lt. Jackson says the key to fire safety in a
neighborhood like Home Park is to educate the vast

numbers of rental property owners. According to
Jackson, students and renters are not as likely to take
percautions with property because they don't own it.
To this end, the Association has asked Georgia Tech
President John Crecine to support our meeting with the
Tech housing office to begin an education program and
rental check list for students renting off-campus,
particularly in Home Park.

LAND USE COMMITTEE REPORT

Approved a variance at the comer of 14th Street and
Atlantic Drive to build into the 20 foot sideyard set-
back. This commercially-zoned property is being
developed to accommodate a 2-story brick office build-

ing which will be occupied by the property owner, areal ;

estate appraiser. The case must come before the Board
of Zoning Adjustment April 7.

Reported an erroneous building permit at 491 Lynch
Ave. The City issued a permit for construction of a 3-
bedroom house with only one off-street parking place.
This is the site of the house fire in November which
totally destroyed the existing house. Zoning law states
that when a building is more than 60% destroyed, then
the current zoning laws must be met. In this case, the

| current zoning calls for one off-street parking place per

bedroom. This is the second time that the city has
issued an incorrect building permit for this reason in
Home Park. It is the business of the Association to see
that all zoning laws are met and building permits issued

properly.

Upcoming variance: A garage to be built in the sideyard
setbacks of a home at the corner of McMillan and

will hear the case April 7.

ABANDONED VEHICLES

Please call all abandoned vehicle reports into the Asso-
ciation office at 872-4572. This list will be passed on to
the Beat Officer weekly. Officer Rocky Merritt says it is
difficult to tag some cars because it is not obvious that
they are abandoned. Ifyou havea vehicle sitting in front
of your residence for more than 1-2 weeks without its
having been moved, you should suspect that it is
abandoned.

NEIGHBOR AND TECH POLICE
___-___ SAVE PEPSI MACHINE _
Thanks to the vigilance of a neighbor and the quick
response of Georgia Tech solice, the Pepsi machine in |
front of the Rolling Stone Press on Calhoun Street is
soon to be back home.

According to Rolfing Stone Pas owner, Wayne |
Kine, a neighbor notified Tech police around 4:30 a.m. |
Sunday, March 19, that the Pepsi machine on the |
sidewalk was being loaded into a van by at least three
men. Officers from Tech were able to intercept the
vehicle and give chase.

The chase ended up on the railroad tracks near
Jefferson Street off Bankhead Hwy. Officers chased the
perpetrators on foot but were unable to catch them.
And a subsequent tag check of the van showed it to be
stolen.

Mr. Kline contributes the successful retrieval of his |
drink machine to the quick thinking of his neighbor and
the quick response of the Georgia Tech Police Depart-
ment.
