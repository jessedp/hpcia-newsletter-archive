ATLANTA MOSQUE
GRANTED VARIANCE

The city of Atlanta’s Board of Zoning Ap-
peal in their April meeting granted the At-
lanta Mosque a variance on their property
located on 14th Street. The Mosque asked
fora variance to build 10 feet into the 20 foot
set back along their property line on Tumlin
Street.

The Mosque plans to start construction this
fall on an educational facility for children of
the religious facilities’ members. Accord-

| ing to Lamar Roberts, senior project man-

ager from the archiieciural firm of Cherry,
Roberts and Sullivan, the construction plans

call for a staircase to be in the setback, not the

actual building.

Roberts also says that the building will have
a mid-eastern flair and will incorporate
water, green grass, flowers and planting
boxes into the landscape design. “It will not
be a bleak, rectangular building in the
middle of the parking lot,” says Roberts.

The Association looks forward to working
with the Mosque on a building that will
benefit the neighborhood through its
uniqueness and landscaping that will help
beautify the area.

"| FURTHER NOTE:

od
*

The Land Use Committee of the Community
Association, acting on the wishes of the

majority of property owners surrounding the
Mosque, and in accordance with the Atlanta
Zoning Ordinances, recommended that the
City not grant this variance. The Associa-
tion has registered a protest with City Coun-
cil members on what seems to be a disregard
for the Zoning Ordinances governing vari-
ances. There are four conditions for granting
Yarienses and they all must be met. The As-
sociation feels that the property belonging to

the Mosque did not fit these Conditions and
should have been denied a variance on those
gounds alone.
