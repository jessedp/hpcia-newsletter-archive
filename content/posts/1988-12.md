result in citations to go to court. Mr. Scruggs says the
first street to be ticketed will be State Street, the main
thoroughfare into the area.

TRIPLEX ON FRANCIS STREET
MUST GO

City inspectors have identified a triplex on Francis
Street and have told its owner that the third
apartment must go. City inspector Donald Plair says
that not only must the owner take out the third
kitchen, he must open the unit up so that it obviously
belongs to one of the two remaining units.

Triplexes are not allowed under the R-5
zoning in Home Park, and duplexes are not allowed
on lots ofless than 7500 square feet. The Home Park
Association urges residents to be diligent in seeing
that these zoning regulations are enforced.
