DEVELOPMENT FORUM UPDATE

The plans for the Home Park
Development Forum are taking shape
with almost all participants in place.
Those committed to the October panel
discussion on the future of Home Park are
Councilmember Buddy Fowlkes,
Planning Bureau Director Fernando
Costa, a Turner Broadcasting System
representative, Patty Boykin of Buckhead
Realty, Bob Reeves of Northside Realty,
Ed Briesemeister of Cithome Developers
(developers ofthe Home Park Elementary
School), and Jack Fenwick of Georgia
Tech.

“what- iffing” on the future of Home Park.
“The Forum should prove ic be interesting
with a variety of elements represented.

POLICE PATROLS STEPPED UP

Zone 5 officers have assured Home Park
that patrols have been stepped up in
response to the recent outbreak of crime
in the neighbrohood. The Association is
doing allit can to help detectives and local
beat officers. Lt. Worthan has answered
our request that all detectives working the
area be encouraged to share their infor-
mation to bring about some arrests soon.

All information called into the Association
offices has been forwarded to the Zone 5
headquarters as well as to the detective
bureau. Again, the police encourage resi-
dents to call in all suspicious individuals
and/or activities immediately. Call 911.

One outcome of increased patrols in the
neighborhood has been the increase of
ticketing for parking violations. Lt. Juhan
of Zone 5 states that officers cannot
patrol the area and ignore violations ona
selective basis. It is illegal to park on
sidewalks and the city can tow vehicles
immediately for this offense. Renters are
encouraged to call their landlords to
discuss the possibility ofadding off-street
parking to certain residences.

ATLANTIC DRIVE STARTS
FIRST NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH

= : _ .. dix 4 Atlantic Drive is becoming the first street
Participants are being asked io do some -

in Home Park to have a Neighborhood
Watch. The program works by getting
locai residents iogether to trade
information on work habits, auto-
mobiles, telephone numbers, number of
people in a residence and their names.
The police inspectors from Crime
Prevention also engrave identification
numbers on items.

The Atlanta Police Department tout the
virtues of Neighborhood Watch pro-
grams in their ability to curtailcrime. Alot
of residents in Home Park don't know
their next door neighbor's name. Simply
knowing who lives on your street could
prevent a robbery.

The Association would like to see every
street in the neighborhood with its own
Neighborhood Watch. If you are inter-
ested in hosting a meeting at your house,

please call Peggy Bronn at 872-4572.
