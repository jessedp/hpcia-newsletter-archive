opening ofits health clinic for senior citizens at the 10th
Street Methodist Church. The Shepherd's Center is a
day center located in the basement of the Methodist.
Church between Tumlin and Hirsch Streets for the

VARIANCE REQUEST DENIED ON
RICHARDS STREET, DUPLEX MUST GO

The Board of Zoning Appeal, at its January 20 meeting,
turned down a variance request for a duplex on a sub-
size lot at 409 Richards Street. The applicants for the
variance attempted to withdraw the request, but when
neighborhood representatives protested, the Board
heard the request and subsequently denied it.

The variance was denied because 1) the Iot size
was less than the 7500 square feet necessary for a
duplex, 2) the duplex was installed prior to receiving a
variance and 3) the scope of work done was illegal
under the work permit granted on the site.

Other work accomplished by the Land Use Com-
mittee included a stop work order on unpermitted
construction on Holly Street.

14TH STREET BUSINESS ROBBED
AT GUN POINT

Trophies, Inc. at 196 14th Street was robbed at gun
point in late January by two black males, one who had
posed as a customer earlier in the day, according to
business owner Jeff West.

Mr. West says one man came into the store,
pointed a gun at him, tied him up and robbed him ofhis
wallet and cash box with the aid ofa second individual
who entered later. Mr. West did not know if the men
were on foot or had a car hidden out of his view. The
store front of Trophies, Inc. allows workers to observe
the parking iot.

A customer eventually helped untie Mr. West who
was then able to call police. It took more than 40
minutes for officers to respond to the call. Although
upset at the response time from police, the business
owner feels that the call was not given a higher priority
because there were no injuries at the scene.

Business owners along 14th Street are warned to
be alert to crime in the area. Police characterize this
robbery as an “opportunity robbery” because they
obviously knew that neighboring businesses were not
active or open at the time of the crime.

voted to proceed with expansion plans of the neighbor-
hood-owned Home Park Learning Center. The Center
hopes to expand its service to 120 children (they
currently serve 80) and to provide more affordable and
quality child care in the city of Atlanta.

The architectural firm of Aeck Associates will be
doing the preliminary design work. They will put
together a marketing package that will be used to raise
the estimated $300-$400,000 necessary for the proj-
ect. The design phase of the project is expected to be
completed in 90 days. There is no time schedule on the
fund raising phase at this point.

The Home Park board of directors based their
expansion decision on the need for more quality and
affordable day care, as well as the need for additional
revenue at the Learning Center. Home Park has been
recognized for providing a unique, quality, commu-
nity-based program for the children of Atlanta.

FIRE DEPARTMENT NEIGHBORHOOD
ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS
MARCH MEETING

A representative from the Atlanta Fire Bureau will be
the guest speaker at the March 6 meeting of the Home
Park neighborhood. The meeting is at 7:30 p.m. atthe
Learning Center at 1015 Tumlir: Stree?.

Fire Department officials have been asked to look
over the neighborhood, its streets and houses, and
speak to the issue of how safe we are. One issue in
regard to streets is what authority the fire department
has in getting the city to make streets one-way or one
side of street parking only without input of all property
owners. Presently it takes 100 percent cooperation of
property owners to get changes io parking. This has
not been easily obtained in the past.
