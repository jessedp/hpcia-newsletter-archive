    <p>Vol. | No. 3</p>
<p>Trees for Neighborhood |
Topic of August Meeting</p>
<p>Cindy McCall, city nursery worker,</p>
<p>will be the guest at the Aug. 11
meeting of the Community
Association. Cindy will be talking</p>
<p>to the neighborhood about how the
city and local residents can work
together to plant new trees where
there currently are none or replace
trees that are damaged.</p>
<p>Ms. McCall is particularly upset
about the damage done to Water Oaks
and Elms by Georgia Power on State
Street. She feels that a good wind
would take these trees down.</p>
<p>The system works in the following
way: the City people will see if
there is indeed a need for new trees
and then will bring in trees that
suit a particular area (sun
exposure, sidewalks, wires are
determinants). The trees are free,
however residents must provide the
labor for planting them. According
to Ms. McCall a 100% success rate is
possible with a good neighborhood
effort.</p>
<p>Wayne Kline who, with his wife Lynn,
owns Rolling Stone Press on Calhoun
will be coordinating this effort for
our neighborhood.</p>
<p>THE AUGUST 11 MEETING WILL AGAIN BE
COVERED DISH AND IT WILL BE HELD AT
THE WATER WORKS PAVILION AT 6:30.</p>

<p>Update on Elementary School</p>
<p>Bids on the Home Park Elementary
School property will be opened by
the School Board at 2:00 p.m. July
29. The neighborhood will know at
this time who is actually bidding on
the property. As the School Board
has guaranteed residents they will
accept only the highest bidder that
has neighborhood approval, it will
not automatically choose the highest
bidder.</p>
<p>The Association is tentatively
scheduling presentations by bidders
at the Sept. 8th 7:30 meeting at the
Learning Center. Area residents
will be notified if this will be the
agenda. If the School Board fails
to hear the bids at their Aug. 11
meeting the Home Park Association
will schedule presentations at its
Oct. meeting.</p>

<p>Comprehensive Neighborhood
Plan Requested</p>
<p>The Home Park Association has
requested the Atlant Community
Design Center to study the Home Park
neighborhood and come up with a
long-term comprehensive plan. Max
Crieghton, director of the Design
Center will speak at the September
meeting to explain what this is all
about.</p>
<p>Political Activity</p>
<p>The turn out for last month&rsquo;s
congressional forum was excellent.
The candidates said that ours was
one of the best attended and
organized forums they had attended.
They were also impressed with the
food. John Lewis was much relieved
to see such refreshments as he
hadn&rsquo;t eaten all day. Thank you to
all residents who helped make this _
forum successful. :</p>
<p>Jackie Saylor, running against John
Lupton for the 25th District State
Senate seat, also addressed the
forum. She and Lupton may attend
the August 11 meeting so please
plan on being there.</p>

<p>PAC Agreement with Police</p>
<ul>
<li>Park neighborhood has signed a PAC</li>
</ul>
<p>agreement with our local police
representatives (Zone 2). Titled
Partnership Against Crime (PAC) the
agreement states that after setting
priorities for problems in the area,
the police and the neighborhood will
work together to solve them.</p>
<p>Priorities set by the police and
neighborhood together were:
burglary, parking, abandoned cars,
traffic control and alcohol use and
lingering on Learning Center
PEOperty.</p>
<p>The police have agreed to increase
patrols, enforce parking violations
more regularly, check for and tow
abandoned cars, and patrol Learning
Center property more often at night</p>
<p>Pa</p>
<p>and..on week=ends. “Sta 2 ee</p>
<p>The neighborhood&rsquo;s responsibilities
include encouraging residents to be
more security conscious, encouraging
residents to phone police, working
with Georgia Tech and City officials
to solve parking problems, and
putting up signs and garbage cans at
the Learning Center.</p>
<p>This can be a first step in solving
some of the problems that are
evident in this neighborhood, but
we must do our part.</p>
