<p>Issues needing to be addressed: zoning, com-
mercial expansion, streets, City services, City
support of residential neighborhoods, crime,</p>
<p>TRANSIENT “HOTEL”
TO BE BOARDED UP</p>
<p>With the help of Councilmember Vic Masliia, the neigh-
borhood association has successfully petitioned the
property owners of the burned Atlanta Stamp and Seal
building to board the site and put up No Trespassing
signs.</p>
<p>According to police officers for the area, at least five
homeless men have been living in the building. And,
says Lt. Juhan of Zone 5, in all his days on the police
force he has not seen as many used wine and whiskey
bottles in an abandoned building.</p>
<p>Recent crime in the neighborhood has proven to be
committed by transients. Although police cannot say
for sure ifit is the men living in the garage of the burned
building, officers have found purses and other items
that were obviously not the belongings of the five men.</p>
<p>Officers were initially stymied in their efforts to
remove the men from the premises because there</p>
<p>were no No Trepassing signs at the site and there was
also no attempt at boarding up the building. When
Portman-Barry realtors were asked to have the prop-
erty owner secure the building, they replied that the
property owner was content to leave it as is and let the
city handle the problem.</p>
<p>Home Park contacted Councilmember Vic Maslia
who reported back that the property would be secured
within a week. As of this writing, there has been some
effort to board the facility but the work is currently
unfinished. The owner will be pressed until the job is
done</p>
<p>LAND USE ISSUES</p>
<p>The Board of Zoning Adjustment voted at its April 7
meeting to approve the variance of the property at the
comer of Atlantic Drive and 14th Street. The owner
wishes to build into the 20 foot sideyard setback.
Construction is expected to start in May on a 2-story</p>

the sideyard setbacks at the corner of Calhoun and
McMillan Streets. The petitioners failed to
show for the meeting. Subsequently, the
Neighborhood Planning Unit voted to have
Home Park meet again on the issue, and the \
NPU would go along with the neighborhood&rsquo;s
wishes. The Land Use Committee will hear oN
petitioner at its April 25 meeting.</p>
<p>The association advised a local resident that
it is a zoning violation to operate a ministry out
of a residence. A special use permit must be
obtained from the city to continue such an
activity.</p>
<p>_<em><em>Some</em> possible boarding houses were</em>
turned over to the Atlanta Zoning office for
investigation. It is illegal to operate a boarding
house in this neighborhood. A boarding house
is defined asa residence witha common kitchen
which is used by residents of the home who
have individual locks on their bedroom doors. A
boarding house may be legal ifthe owner resides
in the home. “Rooms for Rent” signs may
indicate that a residence is operating as a board-
ing house.</p>
<p>The city was also asked to look into possible
housing code and zoning violations at property
owned by the Atlanta Mosque. There have been
reports that meat is being sold out of a residence</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION RESPONDS TO
SUSPICIOUS COUPLE</p>
<p>The association office recently received several calls
regarding suspicious individuals in the area Easter
week-end. It seems that citizens were wary of
two gentlemen dressed in what appeared to
ee be Atlanta police uniforms walking up and
down neighborhood streets.
Investigation into the matter revealed
that these men were indeed Atlanta police
officers doing, of all things, walking a beat in</p>
<p>Merritt, he took the opportunity to get out of his
patrol car and walk around on Easter*morning in
response to several break-ins that week-end.
Officer Merritt firmly believes the only way to
truly get to know an area is to get off the seat and
onto the feet. Apparenily, officers on foot are such
a farity 7 that local residents couldn&rsquo;t believe their
eyes. We commend Officer Merritt for his dedica-
tion to ‘his job and his interest in Home Park “above
and beyond the call of duty.”</p>
<p>Police urge citizens to call 911 to report any and all
suspicious activity. This includes reporting per-
owned by the Mosque, and there was also some sons described as “homeless” who may be going</p>
