    <p>CITY TO ISSUE TICKETS FOR GARBAGE</p>
<p>The city will soon be issuing “courtesy tickets” for
people leaving their Herby Curby’s on the sidewalk
past 7:00 p.m. on the day of garbage pickup.
According to Marshall Scruggs, route supervisor in
this sanitation district, failure to heed the ticket will
result in citations to go to court. Mr. Scruggs says the
first street to be ticketed will be State Street, the main
thoroughfare into the area.</p>
<p>COMMITTEE TO HEAR
TWO VARIANCE REQUESTS</p>
<p>The Home Park Land Use Committee will hear two
variance requests at its Tuesday, November 29,
meeting, 7:00 p.m., at the Learning Center. ;
The first variance request is an expansion of
space for a non-conforming use at the Rolling Stone
Press on the corner of Calhoun and Hirsch Streets.
The owner, Wayne Kline, would like to expand his
studio space and move his living quarters to the
second floor.</p>
<p>The second request is by the Marriott
Corporation which wants a reduction in the number
of parking spaces required for a Marriott Courtyard
on Techwood Drive behind Wolf Camera.</p>
<p>The variance applicants will present their
cases at the November 29 meeting. Anyone
interested in or affected by these requests is invited
to attend the meeting to provide input. The Board of

<p>TRIPLEX ON FRANCIS STREET
MUST GO</p>
<p>City inspectors have identified a triplex on Francis
Street and have told its owner that the third
apartment must go. City inspector Donald Plair says
that not only must the owner take out the third
kitchen, he must open the unit up so that it obviously
belongs to one of the two remaining units.</p>
<p>Triplexes are not allowed under the R-5
zoning in Home Park, and duplexes are not allowed
on lots ofless than 7500 square feet. The Home Park
Association urges residents to be diligent in seeing
that these zoning regulations are enforced.</p>
