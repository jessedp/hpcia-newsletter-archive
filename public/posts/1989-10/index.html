<p>OCTOBER 1989</p>
<p>COMMUNITY TO GET PEEK AT
OLYMPIC VILLAGE PLANS</p>
<p>Russ Chandler, volunteer co-ordinator for the
Olympic Village Planning Committee at Georgia
Tech, will be the guest speaker at the Monday,</p>
<p>October 9, meeting of the Home Park Community.._
Mr, Chandler will show the community a campus ©</p>
<p>layout of the proposed Olympic Village, talk about</p>
<p>its impact on Home Park, and will answer genera,</p>
<p>uestions on the Tech Village Committee’s efforts:</p>
<p>handler stresses that there should be no negative
ee from the proposed 16,000-person facili
to be located on or near the Tech campus. Accord-
ing to Chandler, Tech is pleased to be working with
the community at this point, but adds that the real
input will occur if Atlanta is accepted as the host
city for the 1996 games. The announcement is
scheduled for September 1990.</p>
<p>Acting under the auspices of the Atlanta Olympic
Organizing Committee, Chandler brings strong
managerial skills to the housing aspect of the</p>
<p>lanning process. Currently CEO of United Plastic</p>
<p>ilm, Chandler is an avi peice of Georgia
Tech with the new baseball field named after him
as well as a Chair in the Industrial Engineering
Department.</p>
<p>Home Park is looking forward to Te about how
we can participate in this city-wide effort. And we
easter for changing meeting dates so often.
ope eee in November we can be back on our
regular first Monday of the month schedule.</p>
<p>OVERLAY OF SPI
ON COMMERCIAL AREAS STUDIED</p>
<p>The Community Design Center of Atlanta has
agreed to begin a study of the commercial segment
of Home Park. Working with Graduate City Plan-
ning students from Georgia Tech, the Design Cen-
ter will look at the commercial sector with an eye
for modifying the current zoning to disallow certain
businesses that would not be compatible so close
to residential areas but which are allowed under
the current zoning regulations.</p>
<p>Max Creighton, director of the Center, is familiar
with Home Park through his organization’s work
putting together the Special Public Interest desig-
nation for the neighborhood in 1987. According to
Creighton, the first phase of the new project will be
an inventory of the existing businesses as far as</p>
<p>e of business, building size, parking acces-
sibility, etc. Creighton says that it will be important
to make sure that any added restrictions will not
be too tough for already existing businesses.</p>
<p>several months and</p>
<p>The community association is working with the
City of Atlanta zoning office on this project which
was initiated several years ago but not pursued
because of the emphasis put on residential zoning
at the time. Initially the association looked at
re-zoning, but Zoning Chief Bill Kennedy recom-
mends overlaying the SPI on the commercial area
ar*an alternative. The project is expected to take</p>
<p>business ventures in the
area will participate in the process.</p>
<p>NEIGHBORHOOD SUPPORTS CITY
COUNCIL FORUM</p>
<p>Neighborhood turn-out was heavy for the Septem-
ber 14 City Council Forum at the Home Park
Learning Center and was much appreciated by all
participating candidates.</p>
<p>At-Large Candidates Robb Pitts and Barbara
Asher, running unopposed like most of their at-
large colleagues, thanked the community for hold-
ing the forum which was one of the very few held
during this election season for local office seekers.
The sole contested at-large post, #15, has two
candidates, Shiela Brown and Charles Huddles-
ton. Brown stated her pro-neighborhood position
and outlined her many years of service as a City of
pee employee. Huddleston was unable to at-
tend.</p>
<p>Councilmember Asher also took the opportunity to
lash out at the Neighborhood Election Coalition’s
“Report Card” on City Councilmembers. Saying
she was “flabbergasted” at the issuance of the
report card, she further questioned the methods
that were used for recognizing absences and
abstentions. The Report Card was inserted in
September’s Home Park Newsletter.</p>
<p>District 7 candidates “Buddy” Fowlkes and Tom
Alvis faced off in their positions on neighborhoods
with Fowlkes accusing Alvis of trying to sell out
neighborhoods. Alvis was instrumental in putting
together the Buckhead Triangle buy-out which the
city subsequently denied rezoning, effectively kill-
ing the effort. Alvis insists that Atlanta’s neighbor-
hoods are the City’s prime assets and should be
protected before they&rsquo;re allowed to deteriorate.</p>
<p>Fowlkes and District 8 candidate Vic Maslia
reminded Home Park of their past involvement in
legislation or deeds that have benefitted the neigh-
borhood. Fowlkes cited his co-authorship of the
SPI #8 resolution with then-councilmember
Richard Guthman and his sole authorship of the
recent Residential Parking Permit Ordinance. Mas-
lia cited his role as Santa Claus for area disad-</p>

wood and 14th Street, his apport of the Eaadng
Permit ordinance through the Transportation
Committee, and his and Fowlkes’s support of the
neighborhood&rsquo;s request for CDBG money for ex-
panding the Community Center.</p>
<p>Invited to attend but not participating were District</p>
<p>8 candidate Clair Muller, and at-large candidates</p>
<p>oe Long Banks, Morris Finley and Myrtle
avis.</p>
<p>A highlight of the meeting was the appearance of
Mayoral candidate Hosea Williams who reiterated
his position that he cannot let Maynard Jackson
run unopposed and that Jackson has still refused
to debate him, District 4 Board of Education Can-
didate Tom Elger also stopped by to introduce
himself to Home Park voters.</p>
<p>A huge “Thank you” to the neighborhood for
making this evening a success. 3 =.</p>

community meeting.</p>
<p>CURRENT PRESIDENT TO SERVE
ONE MORE YEAR</p>
<p>The Home Park Board of Directors voted at its
August meeting to extend the term of the current
pe by one year. President Lee Richardson</p>
<p>as been doing an outstanding eben the various
projects facing the ey al this time, and the
Board feels that continuing the current leadership
would be beneficial to the neighborhood. Projects
cro atly underway include: the $500,000 expan-
sion of the Community Center, the implementation
of the Residential Parking Permit system, and the
commercial SPI overlay.</p>
<p>Current Vice President Elaine Hadden-Golladay
will also continue in her office and will take over
from Richardson in 1991.</p>
<p>7 AM</p>
<p>BOARD NOMINATIONS SOUGHT</p>
<p>The nominating committee of the Home Park Board
of Directors is seeking nominees to fill 3 vacancies
for the upcoming year. Under Home Park by-laws
each board member serves a two-year term at the
end of which they can be renominated or elect to
step down.</p>
<p>Board members can either live or work in the
neighborhood or have an interest in the area. A
strong background in City Land Use matters will
be a deciding factor for at least one nomination this
year. The current board is made up of repre-
sentatives from politics, business, residents, Geor-
gia Tech, students and experts needed for
opeiee the association and child care center.
The board meets 6 times per year with committees
meeting as often as necessary.</p>

<p>CRIME UPDATE</p>
<p>There have been numerous crimes in the area
recently:</p>
<p>— auto theft on 10th Street
— burglary and auto theft on Atlantic Drive</p>
<p>— break-ins on Tumlin and Calhoun Streets, the
10th Street Methodist Church and Holly Downs</p>
<p>If you do not have central air/heat and must leave
windows open, it may be wise to get pete ae bars.
Most of these crimes happen in broad an i ou and
Tech students are particularly vulnerable because
thieves familiar with the area are aware that stu-
dents generally have lots of Oe like stereos, CD&rsquo;s,
bicycles, computers, etc., and are gone during the
day. Ask your property owner to adequately secure</p>
<p>our residence. D, AGAIN, PLEASE D. ot</p>
