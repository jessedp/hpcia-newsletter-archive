<p>JUNE 1989</p>
<p>Vowing to become a “hands-on” mayor, and to devcite
more time to “day-to-day operations,” Fulton County</p>
<p>Commissioner and Mayoral candidate Michael Lomax:</p>
<p>spoke to a group of between 35 and 40 Home Park
residents at the May community meeting.</p>
<p>“The mayor should be the manager or administra-
tor, should do less travelling, and should see that City
services are performed, not City Council Members,”
said Lomax.</p>
<p>Lomax also said that he would support the forma-
tion of a regulatory commission to see that ordinances
such as the Herby Kerby law are enforced. It is against
city ordinances to leave the Herby Kerby on the side-
walk, but the ordinance is almost impossible to enforce
and judges often scoff at enforcing it.</p>
<p>The mayoral candidate also indicates that he is a
staunch supporter of protecting our neighborhoods.
This means strengthening and enforcing zoning ordi-
ances, codes and Comprehensive Development Plan-
ning, increasing the police force, and promoting owner
occupied housing.</p>
<p>When questioned about the high cost ofsome of his</p>
<p>_| programs, Lomax suggested shifting monies. from</p>
<p>currently high-funded departments to direct services
departments. He also did not rule out going to Atlanta
residents to see what they were willing to pay.</p>
<p>One proposal put forth by Mr. Lomax that would
have direct implications for Home Park is promoting
more involvement with local communities by Georgia
Tech, Georgia State University and Atlanta University.
The candidate said that this would be a priority item on
his agenda.</p>
<p>The Home Park Community Association hopes to
have more candidates address the monthly meetings
as the election draws near. We hope to have mayoral
candidate Maynard Jackson speak at a special commu-
nity picnic in the park on July 10.</p>
<p>LOMAX SPEAKS * =</p>
<p>TECH BUYS OUT BAPTISTS</p>
<p>In a more than $1 million deal, the Geergia Institute of
Technology bought the North Atlanta Baptist Church at
“be comer of Hemphill and 10th Streets. Although not
final until voted on by the Board of Regents, all parties
see the sale as a done deal.</p>
<p>Under the purchase agreement, the congregation
of the church, which has dwindled from a one-time
high of 1,000 to only 60-75 active participants, will be</p>
<p>able to use the sanctuary for the next 18 months. The</p>
<p>educational facility of the church will be used for|
housing Tech administrative offices. As of this date, no
plans have been made for the sanctuary when it’s
vacated by the congregation. A technical museum has
been proposed as one use.</p>
<p>Also included in the purchase, and marking Tech&rsquo;s
first encroachment north of 10th Street, is the parking
lot across from the church. Jack Fenwick of Tech&rsquo;s
facilities management office says that they will fix the
fence, do some landscaping, and probably only allow
Tech-stickered vehicles to park at this site.</p>
<p>According to Jack Holmes of the Baptist Church, the
sale of the facility was heartbreaking, but that the</p>
<p>congregation knew tt was time to sell) Holmes feeis }~</p>
<p>that the almost $1.5 million price tag was fair, and that
Tech acted exira-fair in their dealings with the church.
The church hopes io relocate in the area, says Holmes,
because of their ties to the community. The North
Atlanta Baptist Church has been at its current location</p>
<p>since 1954.</p>
<p>WHAT DO YOU MEAN PARKED THE
WRONG WAY!!??</p>
<p>In their efforts to help Home Park with its severe
parking problems, the City of Atlanta has authorized a
“meter maid” to patrol the community on a weekly
basis. These “meter maids” have been zealous in their
efforts right down to ticketing cars parked the wrong
way.</p>
<p>It seems that few people are aware of the law that</p>

<p>| says vehicles must be parked at the curb going with the
flow of traffic, not away from it. This ignorance of the
law has created some outraged residents upon finding
their $25.00 tickets.</p>
<p>Home Park is very fortunate to be getting this type
of service. Unfortunately the officers must ticket all
offenders. We cannot give them alist of grievances that
exclude some infractions. It’s all or nothing. We thank
the Atlanta Police for their vigilance and urge them to
keep up their efforts. As for persons that park in the
neighborhood, you might want to purchase a driver&rsquo;s
license test manual for an update on parking proce-
dures.</p>
<p>IN-TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD/</p>
<p>Representatives from the four in-town neighborhoods
of Home Park, Ansley Park, Midtown and Sherwood -
Forest have been geiting together once a month to |
exchange ideas, problems, solutions and grievances.</p>
<p>The onset of these meetings was the result of the
Midtown Business Association no longer having repre-
sentation from the neighborhoods on their Board of
Directors. When approached about this decision, the
MBA reacted by setting up a Neighborhood/Business
Council. It is hoped that the four neighborhoods can
work,together with the Midtown Business Association
to influence decisions that effect the neighborhoods
and business community.</p>
<p>One project that Home Park feels the alliance can
tackle, immediately is the beautification of the inter-
section of Techwood Drive and 14th Street. This area
is the entrance into all of our neighborhoods and the
Midtown business district. The northeast comer of this
intersection has become an eyesore to drivers and
pedestrians who pass by it daily, and it’s going to take</p>

<p>JUNE 5 MEETING — OPEN FORUM</p>
<p>The Monday, June 5, meeting of the Home Park
Community will be an open question and answer
forum for neighborhood residents or other interested
parties. There are a lot of projects going on in the
neighborhood and the executive director and board
president will be available to field any questions or
inquiries.</p>
<p>The meeting is at 7:30 p.m. at the Learning Center,
which is at the corner of Calhoun and Tumlin Streets.
We hope that you will take the time to find out what&rsquo;s
happening in your community.</p>
