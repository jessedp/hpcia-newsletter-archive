    <p>WHAT IS HPCIA AND
WHO IS PEGGY BRONN</p>
<p>January is membership drive time in Home Park. For
those of you who are still wondering what HPCIAis, who
the executive director is, and if you should get involved,
_ please read the following.</p>
<p>The Home Park Community Improvement
Association, Inc. (HPCIA) was started in 1972 by local
community leaders, notably Jugg Harris of Home Park
and the Reverends Ken Kulp and Frank Windom of the
10th Street Methodist Church. In 1974, the Association
opened the non-profit Home Park Child Care Cent © to
provide day care for neighborhood children.</p>
<p>The association&rsquo;s goals are to improve the qu yof
life in the area and to provide quality child cato&ndash;~_ tre _]
community — in this case, the Atlanta. comenecine vine .
Home Park neighborhood actually ¢ owns the Home Park.</p>
<p>Learning Ceriter and furids frorm the Center pay forthe</p>
<p>newsletter, for the executive director, and for special
events put on for the benefit of local residents.</p>
<p>One of the recent successes of the HPCIA h&raquo; been
the creation of the SPI (Special Public Interest) District for
Home Park in 1987. The neighborhood can now amend
the zoning for this area to make living a little better. Other
on-going matters include no-parking areas, one side of
street parking only, zoning violations reported, cars
parked in yards removed, cards on sidewalks towed,
garbage pickup improved, and overgrown lots cleaned
up, just to name a few.</p>
<p>The role of the executive director was created in 1985
after the Learning Center moved to its new address at the
old Home Park recreation center. Previously the center
was located at what is now Tech Plaza, and the board of
directors were running the organization as well as
working at full-timejobs. In 1984, Pegsy was hired as the
day care center&rsquo;s fourth Director and has been with Home
Park since then.</p>
<p>Peggy and her family moved into the Home Park
neighborhood in 1979. Her son Erik was one of first
toddlers at the child care center in 1981, when Peggy first
became involved in Home Park activities. Even though
the Brénns moved from the neighborhood in 1984 fora</p>
<p>larger house after a second child, Peggy stayed on as i</p>

<p>advisor to the center helping to raise money and doing
administrative work from her home as a volunteer.</p>
<p>As executive director of the HPCIA Peggy is in charge
of seeing that the goals of the organization are achieved.
She is available to every citizen in the neighborhood to
help with any problem or to research any matter that may
involve the City of Atlanta. One city council member
thanked her recently for doing preliminary work on
situations that were handled more quickly as a result of
Peggy&rsquo;s initial foot work.</p>
<p>Peggy also sees that Board members stay involved,
that funds are spent properly, that the center stays
healthy and maintains the racial and socio-economic mix
of children that we are proud to have, and that the police
as well as city services give this small in-town</p>
<p>neighborhood more than their fair share ofattention. She</p>
<p>-yatso writes and-mails outthe monthly newsletter.
It is probably safe&rsquo;{é. sey that Home Park is the only</p>
<p>| neighborhood in Atlanta that can boast an Executive
Director, especially one that is paid t0 take care of</p>
<p>neighborhood matters. Other neighborhood leaders
attribute Home Park&rsquo;s resurgence to their having a full-
time person handling residents’ concerns.</p>
<p>Some personalinformation on Peggy: she is from the
Florida Keys, she is married and has two children, one of
whom is adopted from Korea; she has a Bachelor’s
degree in Journalism from the University of Georgia and
and a MBA from Georgia State University in Marketing.
Prior to joining HPCIA, Peggy worked in the Research
Communications office at Georgia Tech. She has lived in
Atlanta for 11 years.</p>
<p>There is one problem with Peggy&rsquo;s job, however, she
can&rsquo;t do it without citizen input. To join Home Park and
to get involved mail or bring to the January 9th meeting
the attached membership form along with your dues for
the year.</p>
