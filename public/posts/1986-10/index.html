<p>Board sets up Scholarships at
Learning Certer</p>
<p>Acting at its July meeting, the
Board of Directors of the Home Park
Community Improvement Association
set up scholarship funds to go to
children of Home Park residents.
The scholarships are to be used to
attend the Home Park Learning
Center. Applications will be taken
in January from area residents who
are low income and who wish for
their pre-schoolers to attend the
Center.</p>
<p>Funds from the scholarship come from
an endowment set up by the
Association after selling the
property at 10th and Hemphill. The
endowment, known as the Home Park
Fund, is being administered by the
Metropolitan Atlanta Community
Foundation.</p>
<p>Residents Identify Advantages/</p>
<p>Disadvantages to living in Home Park</p>
<p>A recent survey of Home Park
residents shows that convenience to
jobs and &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening&rdquo; are
primary advantages to living in this
in-town neighborhood. The
disadvantages were rental property
not being kept up, garbage cans left
on streets, and on-going traffic
problems.</p>
<p>This survey was commissioned by our
Neighborhood Planning Unit (NPU-E)</p>
<p>«equelty</p>

<p>and will be used by them in a study ;
on in-town living. Our own</p>
<p>Association will use the results for</p>
<p>its own planning and for marketing</p>
<p>our neighborhood as a &ldquo;Great Place</p>
<p>to Live in Atlanta.&rdquo;</p>

<p>implemented a new system whereby its
neighborhoods can obtain relief from
traffic problems. The program is</p>
<p>called Neighborhond_ Traffie-Mane ge —
ment. Like the PAC agreement, it</p>
<p>also calls for cooperation from
neighborhood residents and city</p>
<p>officials for implementation.</p>
<p>The Association&rsquo;s request to
participate in the program has been
approved. The next step is circu-
lating a petition to neighborhood
residents that live on streets
identified as problem areas.
Two-thirds of the residents, whether
home-owners or renters, on any street
must sign the petition in order for</p>
<p>it to be considered. The HPCIA</p>
<p>hopes to use volunteers from Georgia
Tech in order to get the petitions</p>
