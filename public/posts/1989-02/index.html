<p>” ALLEYWAYS</p>
<p>The Home Park macnbenioeds is riddled with ails:
ways, and what can be done with them is one of
the most often asked questions by neighborhood
residents.</p>
<p>According to Gerald Mason, chief of the public
services division for Atlanta&rsquo;s Department of Public
Works, the city has no jurisdiction over private
alleys and does not do any work in them. Mason
says that alleys are jointly owned by all property
owners with land backing onto the alley.</p>
<p>This means that one person cannot do any-
thing to an alley without 100 percent consent of all
property owners. For instance, if an alley is cur-
renty blocked by a tree and has been closed for a
number of years, all property owners would have
to be consulted to reopen the alley. And vice versa,
no one person can block an alley without 100
percent consent of adjacent property owners.</p>
<p>Cases where a property owner has done some-
thing in an alley without consent of neighbors can
_| be taken to court. And Mason says that very rarely
will a judge rule in favor of the owner. Courts rule
almost without fail, says Mason, in favor of the
wishes of surrounding property owners.</p>
<p>Mason also said that in the case where alleys
are broad enough and clean enough, City ofAtlanta
sanitation trucks could possibly pick up garbage
along them as this was the original intent of the
alleys. Acase by case review of alleys would have
to be made for this to occur.</p>
<p>The Home Park Association would like for the
area to start thinking about using alleys asa means
of removing cars from sidewalks and streets that
are over congested. A great deal of off-street
parking could be provided in back yards with
access off alleyways. However, as in the case ofa
property owner on Terrell Street, the Association
may look into situations where one property owner</p>

number of vehicles sins it’ as access to orle: piece
of property. ice</p>

<p>Kentucky died of smoke inhalation as a result ofthe
fire.</p>
<p>The Association will be contacting the property
owner to determine what their plans are for the
residence which bured to the ground. In addition,
Association representatives have requested a</p>
<p>meeting with Georgia Tech officials to work out a</p>
<p>plan for encouraging property owners to upgrade
rental housing in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Although there is no evidence of the Lynch
Street address not meeting City code, there are too
many houses in the area being rented to students
and other young people that are considered sub-</p>
<p>standard housing by the City of Atlanta. It is hoped
‘that Georgia Tech will take an interest in this
problem and.work- with the neighborhood to put)</p>
<p>pressure on landlords to upgrade such things as
wiring, plumbing and heating and cooling sys-

<p>MBA UNVEILS TRAFFIC PLANS</p>
<p>Association representatives met with members of
the Midtown Business Association Traffic Commit-
tee to view the committee&rsquo;s plans for improving
traffic in the Midtown area.</p>
<p>Some of the plans affect Home Park, especially -
the areas along Techwood Drive. According to
MBA committee member Mark Curtis of Carter &amp;
Associates, the “Midtown Access Improvement” is
a 20-year project with widening 14th Street the first
achievable part. The plan calls for 6-laning 14th
Street from Techwood at the freeway to West
Peachtree and 5-laning the road to Colony Square.
The 14th Street project is expected to take 2-3
years io complete. _</p>
<p>Longer-term plans include widening and add-
ing new ramps along Techwood and adding a one-
way bridge from Techwood across the freeway at
12th Street to the east. The object of all this work
is to improve east/west access for Midtown.</p>
<p>Home Park is generally supportive of any traffic
plansthat do not encourage using residential streets
as cut-throughs or ones that would one-way 10th
or 14th Streets.</p>
