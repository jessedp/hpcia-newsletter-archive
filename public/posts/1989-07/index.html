<p>HOME PARK ASKS TECH TO DUMP
10TH STREET PROPERTY</p>
<p>The executive Committee of the Home Park Commu-
nity Improvement Association voted at its June meeting
to support the wishes of the community and ask
Georgia Tech to sell its recently purchased property on
the north side of 10th Street. This property, a parking
lot, was acquired as a result of Tech&rsquo;s purchase of the
North Atlanta Baptist Church.</p>
<p>Home Park Board President Lee Richardson says
that the neighborhood intends to do everything in its
power to get Tech to honor its pledge not to go north
of 10th Street. Dr. Clyde Robbins, vice president of
facilities management at Tech, has been quoted in the
past as saying Tech will no longer stick to their previous
policy of not purchasing north of the 10th Street
boundary.</p>
<p>Officials in the City of Atlanta zoning office advise
setting up a meeting with the mayor, Tech&rsquo;s President</p>
<p>Crecine and community leaders to discuss this issue.
Representatives John Lupton and Jim Martin have
been asked to help the neighborhood, and Represen-
tative Martin has agreed to help set up a meeting with
all parties.</p>
<p>_ Itis hoped that the message coming from City Hall
to Georgia Tech is one of support in stating that Atlanta
will not lose another neighborhood.</p>
<p>14TH STREET AND TECHWOOD</p>
<p>The community association is currently doing every-
thing in its power to get the northeast comer of Tech-
wood Drive and 14th Street cleaned up. To date the
following has been done:</p>
<p>e Department of Transportation Commissioner
Hal Rives says that DOT has no plans to purchase the
property to widen Techwood Drive, and any plans for
widening the off-ramp will mean the use of private</p>

    <p>funds for purchasing any necessary property.</p>
<p>e The agency for Portman-Barry is more con-
cerned that his name has fallen off the For Sale sign
than in the appearance of the property, and suggested
that the neighborhood purchase the site if we want to
see it cleaned up.</p>
<p>e Councilmember Vic Maslia has been contacted
to have the site declared a public nuisance and require
that it be leveled to the ground and the site be main-
tainted in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>As anyone who drives by this site knows, the area</p>
<p>has become home to a number of transients. The area_</p>
<p>is also overgrown with weeds and littered with alcohe:
bottles, the fence is being destroyed and motorists are</p>
<p>being aggressively accosted with demands for food,</p>
<p>money and work.
Home Park intends to maintain its efforts in devel-</p>
<p>oping the Techwood/1 4th Street area into an attractive_</p>
<p>entryway into Midtown and Home Park.</p>
<p>TECH PLANS OLYMPIC VILLAGE —
WHERE?</p>
<p>According to a recent article in Georgia Tech&rsquo;s publica-
tion “The Whistle,” Tech is being asked to develop plans
for an Olympic Village that could securely house 16,000
people. As quoted by Dr. Al Shepard, project director
for the Tech Olympic Committee for the 1996 Games,
the village could be built on or near the Tech campus.</p>
<p>Home Park obviously wants to know what “near
the Tech campus” means and is Tech aware of the
impact any undertaking of this size would have on the
community. Tech has been cooperative in answering
the community&rsquo;s need for more information on these
plans.</p>
<p>Russ Candler, a volunteer working on the project for
Tech, says that plans could be available as early as
October to show to the neighborhood. Candler indi-
cates that initial plans call for totally encompassing the
campus with a fence so that there is only one entrance
and exit, moving all classes off-campus, using current
dorms and erecting temporary structures on campus for
housing, and not letting anyone drive on the campus
druing the Olympains&rsquo;’ stay.</p>
<p>SENIOR CITIZENS NURSING CLINIC</p>
<p>The Northside Shepherd&rsquo;s Center, a day center for the
elderly located at the 10th Street United Methodist
Church, announces a nursing clinic for all senior citizens.
The clinic will be on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of each
month from 1:00-2:30 p.m. in June, July and August,
<em>and_persons will be seen on a first-come. first-served |</em></p>
<p>basis.
The nurses staffing the clinic come from the Georgia</p>
<p>State University Nursing Department. For further infor-
mation call 875-0509.</p>
<p>UPCOMING MEETINGS</p>

hood activities for the betterment of all.</p>
