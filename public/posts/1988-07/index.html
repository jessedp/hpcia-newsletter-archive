<p>NO JULY COMMUNITY
MEETING</p>
<p>Due to the July 4th holiday, there will be no
meeting of the Home Park community in
July. The next meeting will be on Monday,
August 1.</p>
<p>The July board meeting has also been
rescheduled to Monday, July 11, 5:00 p.m.,
at the Learning Center.</p>
<p>LOOK OUT FOR WHITE
COUGAR</p>
<p>A 1978 white Cougar with two black men
inside has been identified as the vehicle
involved in a number of crimes in Collier
Hills, Loring Heights, Peachtree Battle and</p>
<p>| Home Park.</p>
<p>The men apparently burglarize homes
knowing there are occupants inside in the
evening hours by kicking in the front door.
Articles taken are usually VCR’s, TV’s and
stereo equipment. If you see this vehicle (it
is large like a Lincoln Continental), please
dial 911 and give your information to the
police.</p>
<p>According to Home Park’s beat officers, the
burglars also seem to have a knack for
picking out houses of Georgia Tech
students. The speculation is that students are
less likely to have guns or other means of
defense.</p>
<p>ASSOCIATION COLLECT-
ING CRIME DATA</p>
<p>In an effort to better protect our neighbor-
hood, the community association is collect-
ing its own statistics on crime in Home
Park. Any resident who has been the victim
of crime is asked to call Peggy Bronn and
give her the details on the nature of the
crime and when and where it occurred.</p>
<p>The information will be used to persuade
the City to put more patrols in the area or to
give Home Park its own motorcycle officer.
Crime statistics will also become part of the
monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>Home Park is now participating fully in the
Partnership Against Crime program with
our new Zone. Burglary is identified as the
Most import tant problem facing the-area.
The neighborhood is sponsoring meetings
on how to be safer in your home and area as
part of our responsibility under the PAC
agreement.</p>
<p>If anyone saw a pickup truck at a residence
on Calhoun and Tumlin between 2 p.m. and
4 p.m. Friday, June 10, please call the police
at O11.</p>
<p>NOTE: MAKE SURE YOUR HOUSE HAS
A NUMBER ON IT. HOUSES ARE EAS-
IER TO FIND BY THE POLICE WHEN
THEY HAVE NUMBERS ON THEM.</p>

    <p>NAME THAT PARK</p>
<p>We need a name for our new park!
Scheduled to be finished in September, the
park area just east of the Learning Center on
Calhoun Street needs a name. And with a
neighborhood name like Home Park, the
task is even more difficult; no “Home Park
Park’s” please.</p>
<p>Won’t you help? Call or mail in your
suggestion for our new park to the
association headquarters, 872-4572 or 1015
Tumlin Street. A committee will be put
together to decide the best name, which will
be unveiled (and it’s orignator named) at the
dedication ceremony also scheduled for</p>
<p>~ September.</p>
<p>ONGOING HOME PARK
