<p>Thank You</p>
<p>The Home Park Community would like to thank Clair
Muller and Buddy Fowlkes for being our guest speakers
at the Nov. 5th commuinity meeting. It was a pleasure
havingrour City Gouncil-Kepresentatives toanswer our
questions and direct us with City procedures. Thanks
again, Clair and Buddy.</p>
<p>Business Owners Tea</p>
<p>The First Business Owners Tea was held on Nov. 14. We
would like to give a very special thank you to Teresa
Breckenridge, owner of the Silver Skillet, for hosting the
guests. The businesses that were represented were: David
Childers and Richard Childers, from Childer&rsquo;s Assoc.,
Tina St. Clair, owner of the Kool Korner, Ellen Hopkins,
director, Northside Shepard Center, Jim McKloud of the
Coca Cola Bottlers Assoc., Rocky Merritt, our
neighborhood police officer, John Schnieder, NPU-E
chairperson, Bill Patterson, Traffic &amp; Safety, Home Park
Board, Laura Mantrone, Education, Home Park Board,
Elaine Galloday, Vice President, Home Park Board,
Bernadette Smith, Secretary, Home Park Board, and Jay
Hammer, owner of Hammer Clinic and Home Park Board</p>
<p>member. Bernadette Smith, Board Secretary, conducted
the meeting and shared some very valuable information
with the group. If you are a business owner and were
unable to attend we hope to see you at the next meeting.
The plan is to have these meetings quarterly. The purpose
is to let business owners become acqiiainted and to keep
you informed about what is going on in the community.
Again, “Thank you Teresa.”</p>
<p>Crime Report</p>
<p>According to our officer, Rocky Merritt, crime in the
area is down 51% over last year, which is great!!! We are
pleased with the figures and while we don&rsquo;t want to
alarm you, we do want to keep you informed. We have
had a few reported burglaries: the Northside Shepard
Center, a house on Ethel St, and an attempt to break into
the Learning Center, where the alarm deterred the
intruder. Don&rsquo;t invite crime. Keep your windows and
doors secured and try to keep your property well lit.</p>
<p>In the event you are going to be away for the Holidays,
try to let a neighbor know you will be away, and please
keep an eye on your property. Please make our Safety
Committee Chairpersons Cathy &amp; Craig Taylor aware of
any crime that you report.</p>
