    <p>SEPTEMBER 1989</p>
<p>COUNCIL CANDIDATES SPEAK AT
SEPTEMBER 14 MEETING</p>
<p>All candidates currently running for Atlanta City Council
seats representing Home Park are invited to speak at
the September 14 meeting of the Home Park Commu-
nity. The meeting is at 7:00 p.m. at the Home Park
Learning Center.</p>
<p>There are six at-large posts and two positions
currently filled by “Buddy” Fowlkes and Vic Maslia. The
current at-large council members seeking re-election
are Robb Pitts, Carolyn Long Banks, Barbara Miller
Asher, Myrtle Davis and Morris Finley. Elaine Valentine
McGruder will not be seeking re-election this year.
Charles Huddleston, chairman of Neighborhood Plan-
ning Unit F, has announced his candidacy for ivicGruder’s
vacated seat.</p>
<p>Council members Fowlkes and Maslia are seeking
re-election io their posts and, as of this writing, are
being challenged by Tom Alvis and Clare Muller respec-
tively. Qualifying dates for running for council seats are
August 14, 15 and 16.</p>
<p>Residents are urged to turn out for these political
meetings. When you have problems with City govern-
ment, it pays to know your council members.</p>
<p>COUNCIL VOTES YES ON ..
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKING PERMIT</p>
<p>In an unprecedented, and much welcome action, the
Atlanta City Council voted at its August 7 meeting to
enact a neighborhood parking permit ordinance.</p>
<p>Under the ordinance, introduced by Home Park
councilmember “Buddy” Fowlkes, the city can estab-
lish Residential Permit Parking Areas where only per-
mitted vehicles would be allowed to park in violation of
restrictions.</p>
<p>The ordinance specifically refers to 2-hour parking
zones where neighborhood residents with permits
could park for any length of time. Any unpermitted
vehicles would be restricted to the 2-hour time fimit and
would be ticketed when violating the time restriction.</p>
<p>The effect for Home Park would mean the elimina-
tion of parking by Tech faculty, staff and students
currently using neighborhood streets to avoid the price
ofa Tech parking sticker. It would also mean removing
vehicles parked on Ethel and McMillan by workers at
Brinks and other surrounding businesses.</p>
<p>In order to qualify for the Permit Parking Area, the
neighborhood must submit a petition signed by atleast
70% of effected area residents. The two-year permit
will be $12.00 per person and should be purchased by
every person having a vehicle which would be parked
on the street in restricted areas.</p>
<p>The Home Park community sees this Parking Per-
mit Ordinance as a great benefit to an area where
parking has become an increasing nightmare, espe-
cially to residents who have no cft-street carking. This
ordinance will, hopefully, decrease congestion and
illegal parking, improve the passability of streets and
keep residents from parking on sidewalks.</p>
<p>JACKSON SAYS TECH SHOULD GO EAST,
WEST OR SOUTH BUT NOT NORTH</p>
<p>Speaking before a group of approximately 30 neigh-
borhood residents, mayoral candidate MaynardJackson
said Georgia Tech should look in other directions
besides north when it comes to making plans for
expanding their campus.</p>
<p>Jackson made these statements in response to
being questioned on how he would support Home
Park if Georgia Tech developed plans to expand into
the neighborhood. The candidate believes that south-
ern or western expansion could help turn Tech into a
great urban university because Tech would be improv-
ing areas of the city that are currently in need of revi-
talization.</p>
<p>Other topics touched on by Jackson was the need
for a “cleaner and greener” Atlanta through creative
waste management, creating jobs through encourag-
ing businesses to stay centrally located in the city near
public transit, and getting the state to help Atlanta on
such things as improving bridges and roads.</p>

<p>When asked about his solutions for some prob-
lems, Jackson refused to promise particular actions.
His philosophy, he says, is that he won&rsquo;t make prom-
ises he might not be able to keep.</p>
<p>HONORARY BOARD GETS
“AWESOME” SUPPORT</p>
<p>Home Park’s new Honorary Board got some “awe-
some” support this summer with the acceptance by
U.S. Congressman John Lewis to.serve.on this already
star-laden panel.</p>
<p>The Home Park Board of Directors voted to create
an honorary board earlier this year as a means of
recognizing persons who lend their names and efforts
to Home Park, but who don&rsquo;t necessarily have the time
to be actively involved day-to-day. And Home Park has
been extremely pleased that all parties invited to par-
ticipate joined with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Joining Congressman Lewis, who has visited the
Center and supports federal childcare legislation is: Ex-
city councilmember Richard Guthman and his wife
Margaret, who has worked at the Center with the
children; State Representative Jim Martin, who has
served on the Board of Directors;.Pastor George Owen
ofthe 10th Street Methodist Church, also a past Board
member; and Lynn Jones of IBM, who will be lending
her corporate expertise and support.</p>
<p>This board will be expanded periodically as a</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>Home Park. We appreciate the support from these
participants in their recognition of Home Park as a truly</p>
