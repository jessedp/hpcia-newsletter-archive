The August meeting of the community will be a
covered dish supper at the home of Home Park

lithographic operation.</p>
<p>Time: 6:30 p.m., Monday, August 10

<p>BY-LAWS UPDATED</p>
<p>The by-laws of the Community Association were
recently updated to include, among other things,
provisions for operating the Learning Center and
changing the calendar for electing Board
directors. Beginning this year new Board
members will be elected at the November
meeting of the community and will be installed,
along with new officers, at the annual meeting of
the Association in January. Six new members
are elected every year.</p>
<p>Other changes are: the current Vice President
will become the following year’s president; the
immediate past President will become a director;
the addition of an Executive Director; and the
establishment of various committees.</p>
<p>The by-laws are available for reading at the
Association’s office at the Learning Center.</p>

<p>ONE OFF-STREET</p>
<p>PARKING SPACE PER
BEDROOM HIGHLIGHT</p>
<p>OF ZONING CHANGE</p>
<p>One off-street parking space per bedroom for
new construction and duplex conversions of
existing homes is the highlight of the zoning
restrictions being pursued by the Home Park
neighborhood. The other change requested
fromthe City is that all new construction have a
front door facing the street.</p>
<p>w</p>
<p>These requests have been sent to
Councilmembers Buddy Fowlkes and Richard
Guthman. The councilmembers will then
prepare the legislation for presentation to the
Atlanta City Council. Neighborhood residents
and interested parties will be kept abreast of the
time schedule of the legislation.</p>
<p>We want to thank the following area residents
who helped mediate the final zoning plan with
the Neighborhood Justice Center: Jeannette
Sledge, Chuck Moger, Cyrus Smith, Jim
Steckbauer and Jugg Harris. And thanks to all
residents who turned out for the meetings and
helped in this PEOEESS, whether you agreed with
us or not.</p>
