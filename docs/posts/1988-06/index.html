<p>JUNE 1988</p>
<p>ONE HOUR CRIME
PREVENTION SEMINAR
TOPiC OF JUNE 6 MEETING</p>

<p>ATLANTA MOSQUE
GRANTED VARIANCE</p>
<p>The city of Atlanta’s Board of Zoning Ap-
peal in their April meeting granted the At-
lanta Mosque a variance on their property
located on 14th Street. The Mosque asked
fora variance to build 10 feet into the 20 foot
set back along their property line on Tumlin
Street.</p>
<p>The Mosque plans to start construction this
fall on an educational facility for children of
the religious facilities’ members. Accord-</p>
<p>| ing to Lamar Roberts, senior project man-</p>
<p>ager from the archiieciural firm of Cherry,
Roberts and Sullivan, the construction plans</p>
<p>call for a staircase to be in the setback, not the</p>
<p>actual building.</p>
<p>Roberts also says that the building will have
a mid-eastern flair and will incorporate
water, green grass, flowers and planting
boxes into the landscape design. “It will not
be a bleak, rectangular building in the
middle of the parking lot,” says Roberts.</p>
<p>The Association looks forward to working
with the Mosque on a building that will
benefit the neighborhood through its
uniqueness and landscaping that will help
beautify the area.</p>

<p>&ldquo;| FURTHER NOTE:</p>
<p>od
*</p>
<p>The Land Use Committee of the Community
Association, acting on the wishes of the</p>
<p>majority of property owners surrounding the
Mosque, and in accordance with the Atlanta
Zoning Ordinances, recommended that the
City not grant this variance. The Associa-
tion has registered a protest with City Coun-
cil members on what seems to be a disregard
for the Zoning Ordinances governing vari-
ances. There are four conditions for granting
Yarienses and they all must be met. The As-
sociation feels that the property belonging to</p>
<p>the Mosque did not fit these Conditions and
should have been denied a variance on those
gounds alone.</p>
