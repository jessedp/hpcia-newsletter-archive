<p>MONDAY NIGHT
SEPTEMBER 14 MEETING
GEORGIA TECH STARTS
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
Officers from the Georgia Tech Police
Department will introduce the Home Park
neighborhood watch program at the Monday,
Sept. 14, meeting of the HPCIA. The meeting
starts at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>According to Sgt. Judy Holybee, the Tech
officers will be training residents on how to work
with neighbors to reduce crime, how to identify
and report suspicious activity, and new &ldquo;policing&rdquo;
concepts. Part of the program will be to see what</p>
<p>neighbors are most concerned with and what
Tech can do.</p>
<p>Holybee says that the program will identify high
break-in areas and which neighbors are best for
watching particular houses. There are a large
number of residents that are home during the day
in Home Park and a number of break-ins have
been in broad daylight. The Association urges
Home Park residents to turn out for this
important meeting.</p>

<p>ONE-WAYING OF 10TH AND
14TH STREETS RESURFACING</p>
<p>The one-way pairing of 10th and /4th Streets is
resurfacing thanks to a recommendation being
made by Central Area Study II recently
completed by Central Atlanta Progress. These
two streets were one set of several recommended
for east-west one-waying in the Study which
estimates that traffic will increase to 3,000 - 4,000
peak hour trips additional to the present load on
14th Street with similar numbers predicted for
l0th Street. These numbers are anticipated due
to the number of businesses moving to the
Midtown area.</p>
<p>One suggested alternative that would have iess
impact on Home Park is a proposal to one-way
14th Street going east at Techwood Drive and to
one-way 12th Street going west at Piedmont Ave.
This would necessitate, however, construction of
a bridge for 12th St. at Williams Street across the
expressway to Techwood Drive.</p>
<p>It has been the position of the Home Park
Community Improvement Association m the past
to oppose any move that would one-way 14th and
10th Streets in the Home Park neighborhood.
Please let Home Park Association directors
know what your position is on this controversial
subject. Some time will be given at the
September 14 meeting to get input from local</p>
<p>residents and business owners.</p>
