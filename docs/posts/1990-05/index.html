<p>MAY/JUNE 1990</p>
<p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RESIGNS</p>
<p>Peggy Simcic Brénn, long-time executive director for the
Hiome Park Community Association is resigning her =
position effective June 1 of this year.</p>
<p>Peggy will be moving with her family to Oslo, Norway
where her husband, a Norwegian citizen, will teach at the
Norwegian School of Management. The executive
committee of the Board is interviewing applicants from
the non-profit sector. A new executive director should be
in place by June 1.</p>
<p>The following are Peggy’s thoughts about her experi-
ences with Home Park and her predictions for our future:</p>
<p>“First of all, let me say that I have never enjoyed a job so
much in my life. Nor have Lever worked so hard. I feel
like Iam leaving a little bit of myself in Atlanta through
my work with this neighborhood and with the children at
the Learning Center.</p>
<p>“For the most part, the people have been delightful.
There have been arguments, misunderstandings and hurt
feelings at times, But I think that when you are puiling an
organization through its teenage years into adulthood,
altercations go with the territory. Home Park is now ata
point where it is healthy, viable and strong. More people
than ever are involved in committees, on the Board, the
Advisory Board or just working to make this the best
place to. work and live in Atlanta.</p>
<p>“There are many people that I would like to thank for
their support and constant encouragement. My first
supporter is John Heise. For without John, who served as
president of the Home Park Board for years, I believe that
we would not have the organization we have today. John
stood with me in the struggle to reorganize the
Association and to get the Learning Center in the
abandoned recreation center where it is thriving today.</p>
<p>“I want to thank all of our political representatives, their
aides, and the many City employees who assisted us so
ably; John Lewis, Richard Guthman, Jim Martin, John
Lupton, Vic Maslia, Buddy Fowlkes to name a few. I
regret that I will not be around to work with our
Councilmember, Clair Muller, but preliminary work
shows that she will be an asset to this neighborhood.</p>
<p>“Lastly, I want to thank all of the residents of Home
Park. The Association has worked diligently these last
few years on legislation, ordinances, and policies that</p>
<p>have made some people happy and angered a few. But
the bottom line is the overall improvement of this
neighborhood. —
“T predict:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that Georgia Tech will realize what an asset this
‘neighborhood is to their campus and will use their
resources to work with the community to make this the
nicest and safest in-town neighborhood in Atlanta,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that Atlantic Steel will eventually move and will be
replaced by a mixed use development that will
incorporate and enhance the existing neighborhood,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that current subpar housing will either be fixed up
or converted to quality single family homes (students will
no longer put up with the rent they&rsquo;re paying for sub-
standard housing),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that Home Park will become a model community for
other cities, because of its childcare program, its proactive
stance on issues, and its increased role in city politics.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>FAREWELL PICNIC MAY 7</p>
<p>The May 7 community meeting will be a farewell picnic
for Peggy Brénn at the home of John Heise, 1114
Westshire Place, 6:30 p.m. Participants are asked to bring
a covered dish. Drinks will be supplied by the
Association. In case of rain, the dinner will be at the
Learning Center. Westshire Place is at the end of Eleventh
Street, which runs next to the State Street Academy.</p>
<p>LAND USE RESOLUTION NEEDS VOTE</p>
<p>The Home Park Land Use Committee is requesting
Home Park Community Association members vote on the
following resolution at the May 7 meeting:</p>
<p>“The body of property owners and residents of the
Home Park Community are committed to both the
preservation of the residential character of Home Park
and the encouragement of compatible commercial growth
within the neighborhood. We charge the Board of HPCIA,
Inc., and its Land-Use Committee with the task of
preserving the residential areas and preventing
encroachment of institutional or commercial uses on land
currently zoned and/or used for residential purposes if
the encroachment affects the residential character of the
neighborhood.”</p>
<p>A ballot will be available for paid members at the next</p>

    <p>| APRIL SAFETY MEETING BIG SUCCESS</p>
<p>Home Park residents were well represented at the April
community meeting where promoting safety in the
neighborhood was the primary topic.</p>
<p>After assessing concerns about crime and targeting
specific solutions, Public Safety Committee Co-Chair
Craig Taylor is presenting three specific demands to the
Atlanta Police:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visible patrol cars in Home Park Monday evening and</li>
</ol>
<p>; ese-are-garbase pick-up days-and
the nie eae wants people going = Herbies
and yards to be discouraged from doing so.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Visible speed traps in specific hot spots during peak
traffic hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intensive patrolling on 14th Street near Mozelle’s,
Jerry’s and the Happy Store area.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Taylor also offers the following suggestions: a) REPORT
ALL CRIMES TO THE POLICE and b) Let Craig or Cathy
Taylor know about crimes for the database being
developed for Home Park. Their phone number is 874-
3405..</p>
<p>The Taylors are inviting a representative fork the
Atlanta Police Department to hear Home Park’s concerns
at the June 4 community meeting which will be held in
the Fellowship Hall of the 10th Street United Methodist
Church.</p>
<p>ENERGY CONSERVATION TIP</p>
<p>Replacing one conventional light bulb with a “compact
fluorescent” bulb would save a year’s worth of energy
from a single power plant!</p>
<p>from “50 Simple Things You Can Do To Save The Earth”</p>
<p>Paige errno e es  n ee CN n e anc n p RRL oy Sc ma ES tee NE LS Te
and residential areas hock well together. This relationship
should be fostered even more in the future to prevent
alienation between these two factions as has happened in
other in-town neighborhoods. After all, we have the same
goal.</p>
