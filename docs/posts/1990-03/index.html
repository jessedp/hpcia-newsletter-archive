<p>PAPER INSTITUTE RELOCATES
TO HOME PARK</p>
<p>The Institute of Paper Science and Technology, Inc. be-
came Home Park&rsquo;s newest neighbor in 1989, moving tne
Institute&rsquo;s entire operation to Atlanta from its 60 year
home in Appleton, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Known, until recently, as the Institute of Paper Chem-
istry, IPST is a small, private graduate university now
operating on Georgia Tech Foundation-owned property
at the corner of Hemphill and 14th Streets. IPST will
eventually move into new headquarters on the Tech cam-
pus at the corner of 10th and Hemphill sometime in 1991.</p>
<p>According to Larry Rueckert of IPST, the Institute was
lured to Atlanta because of the prospect of sharing re-
sources with a major contract university like Georgia
Tech while remaining an independent educational facil-
ity. With approximately 220 faculty and staff, IPST has
the largest group of experts in the world providing grad-
uate education; research; and educational, informational
and technical support services directly related to the
pulp and paper industry.</p>
<p>Rueckert says that the Institute will continue to lease
space at the 14th Street site even when occupying the
new building because of the size of their operation and
the multi-year lease on their current facility. Because of
their long-term committment to the area, Rueckert says
that IPST is very interested in working on neighborhood</p>
<p>projects, particularly ones that help beautify the area.</p>
<p>ATLANTIC STEEL BEGINS LARGE-SCALE
SHUT DOWN</p>
<p>By April 1990 all operations of Atlantic Steel west of Me-
-caslin Street will be shut down, says Ron Dervales, vice
president for industrial relations for the steel company.</p>
<p>As reported in the January 15 edition of the Atlanta Busi-
ness Chronicle, Atlantic Steel begins February 21 the task
of removing its melting and casting lines and con-
solidating production at its Cartersville plant. Dervales
expects about 165 of the company&rsquo;s 1100 employees to be
effected by the move of these production lines. Re-
maining at the site will be company headquarters and
several finishing shops.</p>
<p>‘ At one time Home Park housed a good percentage of the</p>
<p>almost 100 year old steel mill&rsquo;s employees. Now, says
Dervales, most employees live in Cobb County and are
not too negatively impacted by a move north of Atlanta.</p>
<p>The Home Park and Loring Heights neighborhoods,
which border the 160-acre Atlantic Steel property, are
meeting to discuss future development of the firm&rsquo;s pro-
perty. As of this date, however, Atlantic Steel President</p>
<p>~ Jesse Webb has said that they are not in the process of</p>
<p>selling property. But, according to the Atlanta Business
Chronicle, he has not ruled out the possibility of looking
at a deal in a few years.</p>
<p>HOME PARK COMMERCIAL AREAS
OBJECT OF STUDY</p>
<p>The Land Use Committee of the Home Park Community
has begun a study of the commercial areas of the neigh-
borhood which, hopefully, will lead to responsible de-
velopment and beautification of the area.</p>
<p>Participating in the study and overseeing its progress is
the Community Design Center of Atlanta, a quasi-
governmental organization which helps local com-
munities with such things as long-range land use plans.
This is the second project that the Design Center has
worked on for Home Park; the first was the Special Pub-
lic Interest Designation project. According to Center Di-
rector Max Creighton, Home Park is one neighborhoed
that he finds enjoyable to work with because it tends to
be more proactive and future thinking, solving problems
before they occur.</p>
<p>The Design Center is working on Home Park&rsquo;s project
with the assistance of students from Georgia Tech&rsquo;s Grad-
uate School of City Planning. Spearheading the student
effort is Home Park Board Member Carolyn Henry.
Carolyn is currently working with other students sur-
veying the commercial areas to gather data on such
things as owner-occupancy, parking requirements, var-
iance requests and commercial uses.</p>
<p>Working with local property and business owners, the
Land Use committee hopes to put together recommenda-
tions to the City for a plan that would enhance and pre-
serve the harmonious relationship of the residential and
commercial sectors of the area.</p>
