<p>Park neighborhood, the community meetings will
be on the first Monday of every month. In the past,
the meetings have been on the second Monday of
the month.</p>
<p>This change is to accomodate land use issues that
must be voted on at the NPU meeting, which is on
the first Wednesday of the month. The Board feels
that by meeting prior to the NPU the community
will be able to provide more input into land use
questions.</p>

<p>ANNUAL MEETING BIG SUCCESS</p>
<p>More than 50 residents and friends of the neighbor-
hood turned out for the first annual Home Park
“Gala” at Bobby and June’s Kountry Kitchen last
month.</p>
<p>Bobby arid June Crowe provided all food which
consisted of a choice of country fried steak or fried
chicken, beans, mashed potatoes, biscuits and corn
bread. Not one plate was left with food on it.</p>
<p>We are already working on the Second Annual
“Gala” for January 1989 although most agree the
first one will be hard to beat.</p>
<p>We want to thank Bobby and June again for their
contribution to this neightborhood function and
thanks to all of you who made the evening a
success.</p>
