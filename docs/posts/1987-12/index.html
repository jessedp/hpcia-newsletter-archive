<p>HOME PARK ASKS FOR
SPECIAL PUBLIC INTEREST
AREA DESIGNATION</p>
<p>Legislation will be introduced at a special
meeting of the Zoning Review Board on
Monday, December 14th in City Council
chambers to designate Home Park as Special
Interest Area Number 8 in the City of Atlanta.
This is the same meeting mentioned in last
month’s newletter, but the date has been changed
to Monday the 14th. The time remains 6:00 pm.</p>
<p>According to Bill Kennedy of the City zoning</p>
<p>IMPROVEMENT ASSN.</p>
<p>office, the SPI designation for Home Park allows =</p>
<p>INC.</p>
<p>EE. Ff</p>
<p>the neighborhood to amend the current zoning to
suit the area’s specific needs. In this case, Home
Park wants the current off-street parking
requirments changed from one-off street space
per unit to one off-street space per bedroom for
duplex conversions and new construction. The
neighborhood also wants all new buildings to
have the front door facing the street. The SPI
designation also provides that no building permit
can be issued without special review, unless
specified otherwise in certain cases by the bureau
of planning.</p>
<p>Special Public Interest Area designation serves
to recognize the uniqueness of areas and helps to
preserve them. Other SPI’s in Atlanta are:
Inman Park, the Midtown District, the Arts
Center Ditrict, the Central Core District and the</p>

Park, or the time for first-timers to jom up. Fees
