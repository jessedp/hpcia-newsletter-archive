<p>“STATE STREET ACADEMY&quot;
NOW OPEN FOR OCCUPANCY</p>
<p>The old Home Park Elementary School,
now known as the State Street Academy,
is now partially open for occupancy. And,
according to Board Member Walt
Knoechel, six apartments in the main
school are now occupied.</p>
<p>Knoechel, who is a vice president for the
developer, Great Oaks Properties, says that
the firm is very pleased with the interest in
the apartments and is looking at the end of
summer for 100 percent occupancy.</p>
<p>The new construction is scheduled to be
completed in mid-April along with the
remainder of the townhouses in the main
building. Rent for the apartments average
around $275 per month, and the town
houses are going for $725 to $1,000 per
month.</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>Knoechel says that the typical renter is an
in-town person who has already lived in-
town and works there also. They are
typically young professionals and work at
such places as IBM and Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Home Park Residents are invited to visit
the model apartment in the main building
from 11 a.m. — 6 p.m. Saturdays and
Sundays.</p>

children with physical and mental
handicaps who would benefit from being
in a learning environment with non-
